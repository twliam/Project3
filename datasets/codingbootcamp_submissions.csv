codingbootcamp,Anyone from Toronto have advice on bootcamp choice?,1669244663,"Hello all, I'm a human biology graduate. I'm not interested in health care and am looking to switch my fields to tech/cs. I've done a udemy course on full stack web development, which most of the bootcamps are offering, rebranding themselves into software engineering. I've narrowed my choice to:

1. Brainstation 


2. Lighthouse Labs


3. General Assembly


After looking through reviews and such, it seems that both of the first two have gone down in quality, yet they offer in person programming and I feel like I will be able to network best there. Anyone have any thoughts on the matter? Regards!"

codingbootcamp,Is an associates degree enough?,1669243416,"So I’ve been accepted into a local college that offers a [college name] diploma. First off (sorry if it’s a dumb question) but is this considered an associates degree? My friend wants me to join him at this college to take this 2 year program for software development and although I was previously very convinced on the whole thing, I’ve recently been doing some research and been hearing that it’s best to just get a bachelor’s which I could also do at a higher expense of course. I’m really lost on if this program will even be worth it or if I should play it a bit more safe and go for my bachelors. Any thoughts?"

codingbootcamp,"Artist to Coder, What are my options?",1669234613,"Hey guys, so I been holding onto the idea of becoming immersed into the world of coding ever since I got out of university. I knew I was going to have to have a side job to support my early years of being an artist fresh out of school, but I've noticed the opposite happened. I hit the ground running being a freelance artist and seemed like I was off to a great start, until a rapid decline of projects being commissioned of the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Coding has always caught my eye, i grew up at such an exciting time for technology and witnessing the evolution got me so excited for the future. Getting back into the mindset of wanting to use my creativity and be extremely marketable, I locked my sights on the coding world. The only problem is, I have no idea how to start!

So far I spent this week researching, asking questions, reading peoples stories, etc. I also spoke to some of the boot-camp sites like Springboard and Coding Temple. They seemed like a good path, I've always excelled in a structured and crafted course so it just felt natural to me. I'm also reading a lot (Like... a lot) of stories about self taught or free courses such as the **Odin Project** (which i started some intro reading last night)  and it really got me excited about having a discord dedicated to helping each other out when needed, resources, the whole shebang.

Of course what it really comes down to is the price of things. The boot-camps are almost the same price as a 2 year college degree, and I'm not so sure I can invest in that much unless i know it's absolutely the right choice for me. Also the after course help (resources to get a job) they mentioned to me seemed extremely enticing, it's something I didn't fully receive from my university.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

Artist wanting to get into the coding world professionally and use my overly detailed observation skills and creativity to build and learn the ins and outs of programs/apps/games/ect. Next to no experience, but great at learning new things. Also have insane amount of free time... like... a lot.

thank you!"

codingbootcamp,Navy Vet (using VETTEC) and trying to decide between a coding bootcamp of 17-19 weeks. Three options:,1669194363,"First choice would be Hack Reactor but they just submitted for approval through the VA for the 19 week course. 

Second and third in no particular order are Sabio and LEARN Academy. They’ve both been approved for VETTEC already. I’m open to other options as well…

I’m 39, living overseas in Colombia and not willing to relocate until it’s time for me to start working, though even then I’d prefer to be remote if an option. I don’t have much experience save for a basic technology course and an Intro to Python course over the summer (terrible teacher), but I’m going to pause my college studies for a coding bootcamp, likely in the spring - February/March time frame. I’m currently taking three gen ed classes, one of which I can finish in a week, one I’ll pass with no issues, and the final one I’m almost done with save for the final which won’t be proctored. I’m very casually taking a JS class from Hack Reactor that ends mid December and will apply myself more as my academic load lessens.

codingbootcamp,Digital Crafts structure,1669169545,"Hey everyone! I've had a lot of people reach out to me and ask how my experience was at Digital Crafts. It would be impossible to cover everything but if someone has a question you're more than welcome to ask here or DM me!

&amp;#x200B;

First I'd like to cover my instructor. They were an amazing person but they are also on a schedule. Keep in mind that this is a bootcamp, and there is SO much material to cover that it would be impossible for that teach to get through all of the material if they had to stop and answer every question. Thankfully, there are DiRs( a teacher assistant ) who was there to help and was a former student at one point or another.

&amp;#x200B;

The curriculum cover Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js among a few other things. Its enough to really make sure you are whats called a Full-stack developer. The front end and back end is covered in enough detail to ensure you can create projects that reflect a real world project. Speaking of which, the projects that you work on will be both solo and team based ones. So you'll be able to pick the classmates you want on your team, you'll use Github ( a platform where you can collaborate on a single project) and build awesome things!

&amp;#x200B;

The school itself employs a good number of people to look at your resume. In fact, there is a day dedicated to making sure its up to par and working on other things that are beneficial to your career. Looking at your LinkedIn and such. The school also has guest speakers who are former alumni who will speak about their experience and in general, give tips and a bit of motivation. This last part is optional but its a nice touch. Oh, and there is a mentor/mentee program. Another thing you can take advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

Like I mentioned above, there is a lot that happens in the 16 week program but if anyone has any specific questions, reach out to me!

codingbootcamp,Self teaching/Bootcamp or CS degree,1669160066,"So I'm in my my 20s and I'm basically starting over career wise. I never went to college and just worked and advanced right out of high school, I've always been interested in tech but I have no programming skills.

I've been looking into what it takes getting a job as a programmer and I don't know how to go forward.

I've been self teaching for a bit and I've been looking at bootcamps like codesmith. but I've looked at jobs in my state and the vast majority even at entry level require a BS degree.

so is it even worth it to self teach or go to a bootcamp especially since I never went to college? most people I see saying they got a job with no degree were either coding since they were a kid or it was 10-20 years ago.

I know it takes a couple thousand hours to be really good at coding. And feel like I'm disciplined enough to teach myself and use the resources of a bootcamp, but really, will any companies actually ever even look at me within the next couple years without any degree?

codingbootcamp,Resources to bolster DS&amp;A knowledge,1669135565,"Hello all! 

I have been considering a career change for a while and recently was accepted into Codesmith for one of their upcoming cohorts.

I’m ready to put in the extra legwork on my own. While I’m aware Codesmith teaches a full stack, my aim is really to be in back-end.

codingbootcamp,The dirty truth about edX/Trilogy Boot Camps,1668997864," I need to put this out here since I keep seeing people asking these topics of wanting to attend a university bootcamp. This is coming from my experience as a Trilogy/edX/2U bootcamp graduate when we finished the course 2 weeks ago.

From what I understand, Trilogy merged with edX when their parent company 2U purchased edX a few weeks ago. The reason for them merging is because 2U is trying to clean up the negative reputation Trilogy had and combine all of Trilogy's backend with edX for their bootcamps. Trilogy no longer exists as a company, it's part of edX now. They're trying very hard to hide Trilogy from ever existing, I can't find any mentions of Trilogy on 2U's website anymore because any references of them have been either archived or outright deleted or replaced with edX.

Here's the problem with Trilogy merging with edX. 

Every single one of these university bootcamps are run by a predatory company called Trilogy Education, for example, if you see UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp's website or any other schools they're supposedly partnered with, scroll all the way down and it will say ""in partnership with edX"" or something along those lines. Every single university bootcamp websites run by Trilogy are copy and pasted and the only difference is they just change the color and logo to match that specific university.  Trilogy and edX are of the same company owned by 2U.

Trilogy hasn't updated their curriculum in years. I'm talking about since 2017. You can easily find them on GitHub if you dig them up. Maybe that's a good thing so you know exactly what material you'll be paying for, but these university bootcamps, and especially mine claimed to offer courses that ""rapidly evolve"" whatever that means. In reality, the material you're getting is mediocre.

If edX plans to update the course material, I'm unaware of that. But from speaking to a few fresh students of edX bootcamps, as of November 2022 the course material is still exactly the same as mine. This is the problem with spending $12k dollars on a bootcamp, you better be sure you're receiving the best material for your money. In this case, you're getting coursework that hasn't been updated since 2017. That's not worth spending $12k which is so much money for outdated material.  What has Trilogy even been doing for 5 years keeping the same coursework? You'll be paying $1k upfront as a deposit as well for some reason. If you think about withdrawing after the first week deadline, Trilogy's official policy is that you will have to pay any remaining tuition to fulfill the $12k tuition fee, or enroll yourself as an ""active non-participant"", which means you get to attend all of the zoom calls but don't have to participate in turning in assignments and projects.

So in terms of $12k being spent on sub-par education, yeah that part is life-changing in a way since you won't be seeing those $ 12k dollars again after spending it on mediocre and outdated knowledge and a mockery of a network, which I will get into.

Don't fall for their claims of ""Network opportunities"" When they say you'll have network from the bootcamp, they mean only for the time while attending that bootcamp. Their definition of networking is being able to interact with each other on Zoom calls and collaborating on group projects, that's literally it.

Oh, and don't try using their career services, you'll save yourself from hitting your head on the keyboard. Career services are bad in general, but edX's career services are on another level. They have these career events once every few days but it outright feels like those Amway motivational seminars where you invite other people to come join. They're just telling you things you already obviously knew because your instructor told you these information beforehand. It's things like ""Life After Coding Bootcamp"" and ""Interview Prep For Web Developers"", things you can easily look up on Youtube...

They have a career event directly from within their 2U website, your chances are slim to none if you're trying to get hired from this event. It's just a mock interview really. Even the instructor said he doesn't know anyone who got hired by this. It feels like a mockery, you pick these ""tables"" and showcase your group project to potential recruiters but honestly, every one of us has terrible group projects so I don't know anyone who attended the career event. 

The whole point of a bootcamp is to force yourself to learn topics that you otherwise wouldn't learn on your own. You will still need to learn more of what the bootcamp taught after the course ends, what the bootcamp teaches is not enough. Trilogy however says otherwise. On their university-partnered websites, they claim once you graduate, you'll be 100% job-ready which is false. No one will hire you if they find out you graduated from a Trilogy bootcamp. The people that I know who did get hired omitted that they went to this bootcamp or outright lied to interviewers about their experience.

As for the TA and instructor, my TA was a recent bootcamp grad, and the instructor taught the same bootcamp curriculum for the last 3 classes so he basically memorized how the curriculum works. Trilogy hires TAs in the hopes of them becoming instructors after the next class is scheduled. The instructors and TA try their best for what they're given, but it's way too crammed with material that no one would reasonably understand in a short time with how much material is there.

In the bootcamp, the main thing you'll be doing to build your portfolio is you'll be refactoring assignments, and in worse case scenarios, filling out blank files that the curriculum purposely deleted and you'll have to figure out what logic or structures they deleted in order to get the application to function as a requirement. You'll be in a nightmare trying to figure that out. And the people who grade your assignments are so passive-aggressive it's hilarious.

You're learning the MERN stack with SQL, Redux, PWA and some other stuff, but the problem is the activities they give you are not practical. It's literally the jokes people from Silicon Valley make about how people's portfolios are filled with projects no one will use. These assignments are literally what tech people make fun of.

As for group projects, Trilogy claims that you'll be using these group work for your portfolio to employers and recruiters. The reality is unless you are lucky to have someone experienced in CS in your group, you won't. The group projects are 5 class days, for 3 hours each class, so there's not enough time to work on these projects. The majority of that time will be fixing your group member's npm and node\_module errors and merge conflicts, so you can imagine all of that time will be spent cleaning up someone's mess. Group projects are terrible anyways, but these group projects were another level of abysmal. You won't even be using these projects for your portfolio because of how terrible they are that it's an embarrassment.

I graduated from my bootcamp last week and I've gotten 4 interviews so far and got caught in 4k when they found out I took a Trilogy bootcamp when they looked into my GitHub and got rejected after the fact. Take this as a lesson that you'll be looked down on for being a bootcamp grad by interviewers, but as a Trilogy grad, it's a whole nother story.

Don't ever mention that you attended a university bootcamp to recruiters, bringing that topic up will instantly destroy your chances of getting hired. Trilogy and 2U encourages you to bring that up to recruiters but I'm telling you the opposite. 

If you mention that you went to a university bootcamp, they will be dumbfounded because they probably just heard for the first time that ""universities have coding bootcamps?"" and once they pry into that, they'll figure out it's not actually by a university but by Trilogy and edX and that'll crumble your chances of getting hired. They'll research Trilogy up and find that the company does very sketchy practices, and they wouldn't want to hire someone from these boot camps because, in their view, they're hiring someone who, since the interviewers don't know what the graduates were taught from the boot camp, they'll think you're trying to defraud their business for attending an ITT Tech-like institution with sub-par education.

You'll be laughed at by recruiters for trying to crawl into the tech world as a bootcamp grad, especially as a University bootcamp grad, many people in my class are completely oblivious that we aren't actually taking a university bootcamp, you're just taking a Trilogy bootcamp with the university's logo on the Canvas website and receive an email PDF of your certificate in a pattern of the university you apparently attended...

Long story short, if you can, PLEASE stay away from the university boot camps that are run by Trilogy and edX. Those are for-profit predatory businesses that do the bare minimum and deceive people with their aggressive marketing, especially with Trilogy merging since they're trying to clear up their reputation. You'll be thanking me and many others later for heeding this warning about these predatory businesses.

I'll be updating this post soon if I have more information I need to put down."

codingbootcamp,Boot camp or pursue a CS degree,1668758719,"Hey guys! Just want to know some thoughts about what I should move forward with, especially in this current economic situation.

My original plan is to attend a boot camp in May of next year, but with the tech freezes and no degree under my resume, I seem to be questioning my decision into investing 17k to potentially be jobless for the next year or so lol. 

I've heard a lot about WGU (Western Governors University) and how flexible it is when it comes to completing a computer science degree. The only downside is I've been out of school for some time that I would literally need to re learn a lot of math due to how heavily it's centered in the curriculum. I do have 48 college credits from my previous time in school before dropping out with College algebra being my highest math credit. I do plan on transferring my credits over to see how many classes I would have remaining.

If I decided to attend a boot camp and complete it, I would literally sell my self short and pick anything available to get my foot in the door lol. The fear is how will the economy be not just by may, but by the time I'm finished with it which would be another 3.5 months. 

Now if I decide to pursue a computer science degree that will take time and effort, not to mention refreshing myself back into subjects I have not worked on in a long time. I do also plan on working full time if I decide to go the computer science route.

Just one more piece of information. I'm currently 28 with no wife or kids. I'd love the idea to go with a boot camp just because of how fast I can complete it (14 weeks) and it would give me a chance to break into the field, without having to use my time to re learn everything and prep myself back in college to complete a bachelor's degree. Although having a CS degree would help me in the long run, the issue is just time I guess.

So far I've been teaching myself HTML and CSS and I'm about to start learning the basics of JavaScript. I know it's my decision in the end but I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts! 

Sorry for the long post guys. Appreciate in advance!"
codingbootcamp,"If I have no degree, is this just wishful thinking?",1668735059,"Hello, I have some college done in Business Management, but no degree and am no longer in school. The only thing I have is experience in a management/supervisor role in Training &amp; Development. 

The only experience I have with anywhere close to code is I worked really hard to get good at using Power Automate. 

So my questions are: 

1. With no degree, is doing a bootcamp a waste of time/money? Will it be difficult or almost impossible to find a job? And if not, would it still be a job that pays very well?

2. Do these bootcamps have ways to where I won't have to start paying until a while down the road while I try to establish a career like some student loans? 

3. How hard is it to complete these camps while working 40 hour work weeks? 

4. I've looked at Codesmith and Tech Elevator, what do you recommend based off my situation, if any at all?

My friend in tech is suggesting I should get cheap courses on Udemy for stuff like Python to really test thr waters before jumping in."

I would love any insight on this. I completely agree that Black, Latinx, and Indigenous applicants should have more scholarship opportunities.  I wasn't trying to be annoying, just curious.

codingbootcamp,1099 vs W-4 Employee,1668569167,"So I’m a Junior developer and I just got hired at a small company (3 employees including myself). I had no degree or experience in the tech field besides a boot camp certificate and some personal projects and I wasn’t really too sure on how much to ask for for a junior developer, so I gave a $30-$35/hr range in the interview with this company (rookie mistake I know 😪). They gave me an offer of a 1 month $30/hr contract with the potential to move to full-time if it was a good fit for both of us. 

So now a month has gone by and I’ve been getting my tasks done before my boss has another one ready and have been getting high praise. I decided it was time to check in with my boss and long sorry short we both decided it was a good fit for us moving forward. I did step in to negotiate a raise and told him that I felt I didn’t properly do my research on the market rates for a junior developer at the time and I felt that I sold myself pretty low at $30/hr. I told him I had done more research now and I wanted to make sure this would be a good fit for me long-term so I asked if it would be agreeable to him to raise my pay to $40/hr. I think I did pretty well for my first negotiation and he responded positively. He said that would depend on if I wanted to stay as a 1099  independent contractor or be hired on as a W-4 employee. He seemed to imply that $40/hr would be doable as a contract worker but as a w-4 employee, he would have to pay extra to have me on payroll so i would be paid less than $40/hr and that I would have to make a decision on that and he would be able to give me a response. 

I’ve never worked as 1099 worker before so I’ve just been saving %20 of what they pay me for taxes next year. After doing some math it seems like that at 40 hours a week at $40/hr biweekly for a 1099 worker would be $2560 after taxes (80hrs * $40/hr *80% after taxes) and according to smartasset.com that same paycheck would be $2262 after taxes (I live in California) which he’s implying he won’t be able to pay me that much as w-4 employee anyway. 

The only benefits I would get as a w-4 employee would be paid holidays and PTO but the extra $300 biweekly seems way better. Just wondering if I’m missing something/doing my math wrong or if someone has been in this position before and has good advice on which route to take.

Thanks in advance!"
codingbootcamp,"Is part-time, online bootcamp worth it?",1668557685,"I’m considering UPenn’s 6 month “Full Stack Flex Program”. They say it’s meant to fit in with your regular life and job, but that seems like A LOT. Classes are Monday, Wednesday and Thursday nights from 6:30-9:30pm, with an additional 25-30 hours of homework and projects per week. That’s almost another full time job with the time commitment, but I’m pretty confident I can power through it for 6 months, keeping the end goal in mind. 

My question is, is it worth it? I’ve seen feedback that part-time boot camps (especially online ones) don’t have you nearly prepared enough for a career when you graduate. Is that true? Does it just depend on the individual effort you put into it? I already have pretty advanced knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS from previous college courses, so I’m confident in that area, but I’d be learning everything else from scratch. Should I have a foundational knowledge of JS (or any other topics) before starting a bootcamp? 

Additionally, is it possible to to work a full-time job 40 hours per week, with another 34-39 hours of bootcamp commitment per week? Would I be better off committing most of my time to the bootcamp and not having a full-time job? How do people pay for their living expenses while in the bootcamp full-time? Student loans? Do you need to just have a big savings before starting?

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp finishes in a couple months - recover or start applying?,1668469280,"I’m currently doing a 6 month accelerated full-stack bootcamp to graduate early next year. On the brightside, doing this bootcamp allowed me to dig into my passion and learn more about the history and fundamentals of computer science. Though on the downside, I have utterly and completely lost my sense of self.

Every single week since the start, I’ve had an assignment due every Sunday in a new programming language. After falling again and again from personal hardship and my lack of time to help those issues, I have barely managed to pass all of my assignments (with just enough knowledge to build these assignments).

Now that graduation is moving closer and closer, placements are now being organised for students and I’m almost certain I’m not one of those people. I’m doubting my own ability to find that first job, knowing that I have barely even passed this bootcamp.

TLDR; —————————————————————
With my ultimate goal is to support my elderly parents asap, I’ve decided on two possible plans:

1) Prioritising landing that first job: Maintaining the bootcamp pace - Update my portfolio, finishing those assignments (to be portfolio ready) and applying for work before the bootcamp ends.
Goal: Dig into my passion and openly learn in the workforce and finally afford healthcare for myself and my parents

2) Prioritising finding balance: Complete the bootcamp and get a retail job. Completely redo my portfolio and projects with new tech stack, and possibly try a hackathon. 
Goal: I will feel better and know more, but I still won’t be able to support me or my parents"

codingbootcamp,The problem with coding bootcamps (and any bootcamps in general),1668403161,"This is mostly a rant, but I need to put this out here since I keep seeing people asking these topics.

Any bootcamp that claims to offer network connections for jobs are trying to sell you a false dream. When they say connections, they mean only for the time while attending that bootcamp. Their definition of networking is being able to interact with each other on Zoom calls and collaborating on group projects, that's it.

Don't fall for the bootcamp's advertisements on having life-long relationships with your cohort, you don't want anything to do with your classmates, and they don't want anything to do with you either. All of your classmates in the bootcamp have their own lives so it would be inconsiderate to bother them outside of class honestly. You'll be job hunting and doing everything else on your own after the bootcamp is finished, so don't expect the relationship you built with your cohort to last (if you built one at all).

Oh, and don't try using their career services, you'll save yourself from hitting your head on the keyboard. Career services are bad generally, but bootcamp career services are another level, let's just keep it that way.

Many of these bootcamps from what I've seen haven't updated their curriculum in years, especially mine, you can easily find them on GitHub if you dig them up. Maybe that's a good thing so you know exactly what material you'll be paying for, but so many of these bootcamps and especially mine claimed to offer courses that ""rapidly evolve"" whatever that means.

The whole point of a bootcamp is to force yourself to learn topics that you otherwise wouldn't learn on your own. You will still need to learn more of what the bootcamp taught after the course ends, what the bootcamp teaches is not enough. 

Most bootcamps will hopefully teach you the MERN stack (If they're teaching you the LAMP stack, run...), but how practical the material they teach you to use in an actual production level is another question.

These bootcamps, especially the one run by Trilogy (now known as edX) skim through the material and overloads content in a course that takes 6 months, so no wonder most of the logic doesn't stick into your brain. The instructors and TA try their best for what they're given to teach, but it's way too crammed with material that no one would reasonably understand in a short time with how much material the bootcamps cram.

I graduated from my bootcamp last week and I've gotten 2 interviews so far and got caught in 4k when they found out I took a coding bootcamp when they looked into my GitHub and got rejected after the fact. Take this as a lesson that you'll be looked down upon for taking a bootcamp, and try to omit that you went to one in your GitHub and LinkedIn as much as you can or else you'll face this debacle repeatedly. It'll save you lots of headaches. 

Don't ever mention that you attended to a coding bootcamp to recruiters, bringing that topic up will instantly destroy you chances of getting hired. Recruiters favor someone who did a CS degree more over a bootcamp grad because in their eyes, a CS grad dedicated 4 years of their life into learning the industry, and you, a bootcamp grad, in their eyes took the easy way out taking a 6 month course and therefore aren't qualified for the job. 

In a way they're right, a CS grad has broad knowledge of computers, while a bootcamp grads have a narrow knowledge of a specific subject.

So yeah, now I decided to attend this technical university in 2 weeks in order to have an actual proper education on web development and have the guidance and structure to build proper applications for my portfolio. My bootcamp did have that structure, but it was mediocre at best.

Long story short, if you can, PLEASE stay away from bootcamps, ESPECIALLY the university ones run by Trilogy and edX. Those are for-profit predatory businesses that does the bare minimum to continue staying afloat. Try to self teach yourself before making that jump into a bootcamp, attending a bootcamp should be the last resort if you tried everything and have absolutely no other options. You'll be thanking me and many others later."

codingbootcamp,Codesmith School Performance Fact Sheet Substantially Different from CIRR Outcomes?,1668111021,"I was doing some research and found a school performance fact sheet published by Codesmith which can be found here [https://www.codesmith.io/regulatory-information](https://www.codesmith.io/regulatory-information). It looks like this fact sheet was published to meet a regulatory requirement in California and has not been kept up to date, but I was surprised that it looks like the outcomes on it are pretty different from what CIRR has reported. 

It's difficult to make a direct comparison, but in 2019 the fact sheet reports that 65% of program graduates were employed 6 months after graduation. The two 2019 CIRR reports for the Codesmith Los Angeles Immersive Program report that 89.7% (first half of 2019), and 80.6% (second half) of graduates were employed 6 months after graduation. Does anyone have any more info or a guess to explain the discrepancy?

I want a career in tech, I'm motivated and interview well but I also have no experience in this field at all. 

Is this is worthwhile and good jump off point? 

Also, if anyone has experience with this bootcamp and placement I'd live to hear about it."

I don't want to regret going to work for the next 20 plus years and hate what I do.

Not much new to report, although this week I am starting on the ""System Design"" section.  I haven't had much time to form an opinion on this section, but I like what I'm seeing so far.  I will definitely follow up when I have more of an informed opinion there.  
For those wondering, I've posted the timeline I've followed so far as a part time Fellow down at the bottom.  Keep in mind that each Fellow's path is personalized, so we may not start at the same place or we may move through them at different rates.

So yeah, to summarize: If you need someone to teach you how to solve LeetCode problems and think about algorithms and data structures, Formation definitely does a great job. From what I've seen, they also do a pretty good job at teaching System Design but it's too soon for me to draw a conclusion.

I know there are many asynchronous e-courses available that could teach me what I need to know, but I know myself well enough to know that to actually learn hard things, it helps to have a live instructor, scheduled lectures, opportunities to ask questions, and projects with hard deadlines. 

There are a lot of programs I've seen that are billed as ""fullstack bootcamps"" but these generally spend 50% or more of the class time on teaching frontend skills and basic Javascript programming. I'm looking for a course that starts from the assumption that the students are skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and spends 100% of the class time teaching Node.js backend.

My ideal course would be in person (I live in Toronto) but I know that's unlikely, and I'd be willing to do a remote course based anywhere in Canada of the USA as long as it has live interactive instruction, scheduled lectures, and project deadlines.

codingbootcamp,One of the best roadmaps I've seen for becoming a web dev on your own. Maybe you'll find it as helpful as I did.,1667559697," 

This is the roadmap I wish I’d had when I first started learning to code. I keep it updated regularly so be sure to bookmark it and check back.

The original question was *How do I get into coding and how much do I need to know for you to hire me?*

I am not the author of any of the courses I link to below, nor do I get anything if you sign up for them.

*Last Edit: August, 2022*

\*\*\*

Hi, I’m a Software Engineering Manager at a tech company and a self-taught developer. I would love to tell you exactly what you need to know to be a professional developer and to be hired by someone like me.

**THINGS TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE BEGIN**

1. Learning to code is hard. It can be fun, too, but it is never easy
2. As you’re about to see, there is a lot to learn. Software development is a complex field and there is a lot you need to know. Learning a programming language is just the beginning.
3. You should follow this roadmap from start to finish. Don’t skip any steps and don’t listen to those who tell you to learn other languages or frameworks. Bounding from topic to topic while you’re learning will only extend the time it takes you to reach a professional level. Go deep before you go wide.
4. The roadmap below will guide you on a path toward web development. That’s not the only type of development out there, of course. There are software engineers working in machine learning, mobile development, robotics, and many other fields. I recommend using web development as your entry point, however. There are a lot of jobs available in that specialty, and the barrier to entry is relatively low.

**HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?**

It will take between 1000 and 2000 hours to learn to code at a professional level, depending on your aptitude. The amount of time you can invest per week will determine the number of calendar days between you and your new career.

10 hours per week: 2 - 4 years

15 hours per week: 1.25 - 2.5 years

20 hours per week: 1 - 2 years

It’s probably not realistic to study and practice more than 20 hours per week.

Basically, settle in and try to enjoy the journey. You’ll get there, but it’s going to take some time.

**WILL I BE ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER IF I COMPLETE THIS CURRICULUM?**

You will certainly be qualified for one. If you complete every course in this roadmap you will have a skill set that exceeds most code camp graduates and a better *web development* skillset than many new CS graduates.

It can be tough to get that first job, though. You’ll have to work to get your name out there. Be creative and lean on your network. I have more job-hunting tips later in this answer.

Now, without further ado…

**THE ROADMAP**

**Learn How the Web Works**

The first thing you’ll need to understand is how the web works from a technical perspective. The video below has a lot of information in a short period of time. Take notes, but you don’t need to memorize the whole thing. The most important thing to pick up is vocabulary. These concepts will come up a lot as you learn.

**Learn How to Use Your Computer Like a Developer**

Next, you’re going to need to understand how to use your computer as a professional tool. That means knowing your file system and your command line. I’m a Linux user, personally, but I’ll assume that if you’re into Linux you already know those topics. The videos below are for Windows and MacOS, respectively. The MacOS command line is more properly called the Terminal.

Windows:

MacOS:

**Learn Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).**

If you’re using a Windows computer as a developer, you’ll need to learn about WSL2. A lot of the tools you’ll need as a professional developer will require you to work with a Linux command line. Luckily, WSL2 integrates the Ubuntu terminal into Windows very well. This has had the effect of making Windows a legit platform for web development.

While not strictly necessary when you first start to learn, if your intention is to do serious web development on a Windows machine, you might as well start using WSL2 now.

**Learn to Use a Code Editor**

You’re going to need several tools as a developer but the courses I link to later in this answer will introduce most of them as needed. For now, the main tool you need to know is a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

There are a lot of these available but I’m going to recommend starting with a full-featured code editor called Visual Studio Code. This is not the same as the Visual Studio IDE.

VS Code is a professional-grade tool and it is 100% free. It’s worth taking a little time to learn your way around.

You can download a copy of VS Code at the link below.

[**Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined**Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.  Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

And you can learn how to use it right here:

**LEARN THE BASICS: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies of web development and you’ll need to spend a few months getting good at them. You can do that at Free Code Camp, which is a 100% free service.

In order to complete this step you will need to earn both the **Responsive Web Design** and **JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms** certificates.

This is where you really start learning to code. Make sure you do ALL the projects and challenges. Those are the most difficult part but also the most important. Don’t skip anything!

This step isn’t easy to complete. In fact, my guess is that 95% of the people who start this road map will never get past this point. Not because it is too hard, but because it takes time and consistency.

You can help yourself be successful by setting up a study schedule. Block out time several days a week for study and practice. Make a commitment to yourself that you will use that time productively. Don’t let anything distract you from your goals.

Free Code Camp has a lot of in-browser exercises but you should also try out what you’re learning in VS Code. There’s no better way to learn than by actually building things in your code editor.

[**https://www.freecodecamp.com**https://www.freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)

**MORE ABOUT JAVASCRIPT**

When you get to your JavaScript lessons in Free Code Camp, it might be good to supplement your online classes with some reading. Here is a link to **Eloquent JavaScript*****,*** which is an excellent book for beginners. You can read it for free online or you can pick up a print copy at Amazon. The link below is for the free resource.

[**Eloquent JavaScript**Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition (2018) This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. You can read it online here, or buy your own paperback copy . Written by Marijn Haverbeke.https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**ABOUT UDEMY**

From here on out, we’ll rely on Udemy courses to expand our skillset. We do this instead of continuing on with Free Code Camp because all of the following topics go deep and its worth taking a structured course in each. Don’t be afraid to invest in yourself!

Udemy is an excellent service, but its pricing structure is a little strange. What you want to do is to buy the courses on sale, when they are about $12 - $25 each. When you first register at Udemy the courses will be on sale and I recommend buying at least the first few courses below if you can. Those will keep you busy for several months.

After that, just keep an eye out for sales. Udemy holds them a few times per year.

Let’s keep going!

**LEARN REACT**

Once you understand the basics, it’s time to move into more intermediate-level development. React is the most popular front-end library in the world and an absolutely vital skill for a new web developer.

React projects are a LOT more complex than the simple three-file apps you’ve been building up till now. Just keep at it, things will make more sense as you continue in this curriculum. Don’t worry if things seem confusing at first, you’re exactly where you need to be.

The course below teaches React using functional, rather than class-based, components. This is the modern way to develop React applications.

[**React 16: The Complete Course (incl. React Router 4 &amp; Redux)**Dive in and learn React.js from scratch! Learn Reactjs, Hooks, Redux, React Routing, Animations, Next.js and way more!https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

**LEARN TESTING WITH JEST AND REACT-TESTING-LIBRARY**

Good unit tests can make the difference between a maintainable application and one that devolves into an unusable mess. This is another critical topic to master.

[**Testing React with Jest and React Testing Library (RTL)**Learn best practices for testing your apps with Jest and React Testing Library!https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/)

**LEARN NODE**

By this point in the curriculum, you’ll have a very solid understanding of front-end development. Learning Node will teach you the back-end and enable you to make full-stack applications that involve interaction with a server and database.

The course below is a big one, but it will teach you what you need to know.

[**NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)**Master Node JS &amp; Deno.js, build REST APIs with Node.js, GraphQL APIs, add Authentication, use MongoDB, SQL &amp; much more!https://www.udemy.com/share/1013ho/](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013ho/)

**LEARN SQL and PostgreSQL**

The course above touches on SQL but it's a deep topic and an important one to understand. SQL is a database language and there are many flavors of it, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MSSQL. PostgreSQL is probably the most popular of them but once you learn one picking up any of the others is fairly easy.

[**SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide**Become an expert with SQL and PostgreSQL! Store and fetch data, tune queries, and design efficient database structures!https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/)

**BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

This next step is critical. By now, you’ve learned enough to build your own full-stack web application and you need to cement that knowledge by, well, actually building one.

This project will be your primary portfolio project and will be the first thing potential employers will want to look at, so put your best effort into it. Pay attention to design, including responsive design, and assume someone will be looking at the code. Write good tests and use the best design patterns you’ve learned over the last several months.

If you don’t know what to build, try one of the following:

* A Blog Engine
   * This is a simple CMS or content management system that will allow you to create a blog online. You should be able to create and edit blog posts from an admin panel and users should be able to comment on those posts. You should be able to moderate those comments as necessary
* A Fake Dating Site
   * Create a Tinder-like dating site for superheroes, muppets, or whatever. A character looking for love should be able to log in, see potential matches, and communicate with them. You should create several of these profiles to demonstrate site functionality
* An eCommerce Site
   * Create an eCommerce site for a mock product. Users should be able to log in, add items to their cart, and check out. The app should deduct items from inventory as necessary and you should be able to open an admin panel that allows you to control the whole operation

Any one of those projects will teach you a ton about full-stack development. Once you start planning features and dealing with things like authentication and authorization you will run into a lot of the same pain points that professionals deal with every day. Expect long periods of “stuckness”. Use Stack Overflow as necessary and stay the course. You can do this!

Don’t continue on until you’ve completed this step.

**DEPLOY YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

Now that you’ve built your portfolio project, you’ll want to deploy it in a professional way. One way to do that is to use AWS. AWS is a vital skill for developers but many people outside the field aren’t even sure what the heck AWS even is. That’s okay! Well, it WAS okay. Now it is time for you to start learning about it.

Here’s an introduction video to the topic

And here is a video about how you can deploy a NodeJS application to AWS using a service called Elastic Beanstalk. Note, this isn’t the only way to deploy your app but it will get you some experience with the core AWS services developers need to know about.

**GOING PRO**

When you reach this point you will be very close to job ready. You could probably do freelance work already. If your goal is to work at a software development company, however, you will need to get past the dreaded technical interview.

Interviews at software companies basically have three parts. The first is the “behavioral” interview, which is just your standard job interview stuff. They’ll ask you about yourself and what you like to do, and just try to get a sense for cultural fit.

The next part is the coding challenge. In a coding challenge, you’ll be asked to solve challenges like “given an array of n numbers, find all the subsets of three numbers that add up to seven”.

To answer questions like these, you will need to understand data structures and algorithms.

We’ll get to the third part of the technical interview a little later on.

**LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS**

Here is a good course to get you started on this fascinating topic. You’ll learn about complexity analysis and how to choose the best data structures for a given situation. It isn’t just about interviews. Knowing this stuff will make you a better engineer.

[**JavaScript (JS) Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**The Missing Computer Science and Coding Interview Bootcamphttps://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)

Once you’ve completed the course, you’ll want to practice coding challenges. The go-to place to do that is Leetcode.

[**LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform**Level up your coding skills and quickly land a job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview.https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

**LEARN SYSTEM DESIGN**

The last part of the technical interview is system design. You don’t always need to understand this at entry-level interviews but you might at larger companies or later in your career.

Here is an example of what a system design interview looks like

That video is made by a company called Exponent, and they have an excellent service for learning system design and really for code interview prep in general. The service even includes an opportunity to engage in peer-reviewed practice interviews. I recommend it.

**JOB HUNTING**

Congrats! By the time you reach this point in the roadmap you should be well-prepared to go out and land a job as an entry-level developer. Here are some job-hunting tips

1. You need to have three critical things for potential employers:
   1. A professional-looking LinkedIn profile. Make sure you’ve got a picture posted and some activity to show. Follow some people you admire and post updates about things you’re learning or are interested in. Stay away from “Facebook” style garbage posts. Keep posts focused on your career.
   2. Your Github profile. Make sure you’re showing your best work and staying active with your projects. Some employers look at your recent activity to see how passionate you are about code
   3. A link to your *deployed* portfolio project. It must be deployed! Don’t expect a hiring manager to clone your repo and build it from source because guess what? They won’t.
2. Until you have some experience, build a skills-focused resume. Google that term for details.
3. Get experience any way you can! If you’re doing freelance work, post your big projects on LinkedIn or start your own consultancy and post that as soon as you begin taking work.
4. Network! Join a local coding group and make sure you attend the meets. If there isn’t one in your area, start one. That’s exactly how I got started in my career.
5. If you don’t have a college degree, it might be good to fix that situation. Not all developers have a CS Degree but the vast majority have a four-year degree in *something*. It’s hard to go wrong with CS but other majors you might consider include MIS, Business Analytics, and UX Design. Some schools even offer web development degrees. Note: You don’t need to finish a degree before looking for your first job, but having one will eventually unlock opportunities for you. Highly recommended.

**ADVANCED TOPICS**

Once you’ve landed that first job, it’s good to continue learning. The topics below will help you to progress in your career. Note, you don’t need to do all of these. Rather, pick and choose those that interest you. That being said, you really should do the Typescript one at some point.

**CONCLUSION**

I hope this answer is helpful. It is the product of years of being both a self-taught and a professional developer, as well as a team leader and engineering manager.

Please share this answer with your network. The question of ""how do I learn to code"" comes up on Quora often, and I feel this is one of the best answers to it.

Thank you for reading and welcome to the world of web development.

Good luck!"

codingbootcamp,Which bootcamp did you attend?,1667405536,"I think it would be cool to start a thread (don’t know if it’s been done before) about which bootcamp you attended, cost, curriculum, etc etc, to help others have a centralized post to reference.
I’ll start!

I’m located in USA. The bootcamp I went to is called Thinkful, owned by Chegg, it was called something else before being acquired by Chegg although I am not too sure about the previous name.
I did the deferred payment plan, which means I had to take out a loan for $12k. If you live in cities considered tech hubs they’ll give you a stipend of $1500 month so you can attend full time on top taking out the loan. They do ask that you’re available 60 hours a week if you choose to attend full time and do extra hours with your cohort. They have a clause that they’ll forgive your loan if you can’t find a job making at least $45k/year after graduating…. More on that in a bit.

When I started I was working, and taking care of my son so I decided to do the full stack software engineering part time which was self paced, but I quickly realized that I still basically had to put in 40 hours a week in order to not fall behind on any of my work.

They said if you do the program full time you finish in 5 months, part time 6 months, but you are allowed to ask for 3 month extension, but doing so will mean you forfeit the loan forgiveness part of the contract you signed.

The full stack program teaches everything JavaScript/web development. So I learned HTML/CSS/JS as well as Bootstrap, React, React router for front end, and I learned Express, Nodejs, Knexjs and PostgreSQL for backend. Towards the very end they introduced data structures and algorithms. They do pair you up with a mentor and you have to meet with them for an hour each week, and honestly it’s a hit or miss with the mentors.

After graduating I was paired up with a career coach, and she’s really nice, but all she does really is gather a list of jobs from LinkedIn, Indeed, etc sends it my way and I apply to the positions. Some of them are not even related to software engineering, but the salary is more than $50k because if you get *ANY* job paying more than $45k you have to start paying your loan immediately.
If you choose to get the stipend that is actually not deferred, if I remember correctly, and you basically have to start paying it upon graduating, regardless of whether you’re employed or not.

After graduating I’ve found out about the Odin Project, which Thinkful is a sponsor of, or a partner, so basically the Odin Project teaches everything I learned at Thinkful for free lol.

I’d still recommend Thinkful though, because I did learn a lot of things, and I have a good enough portfolio(I think) that has gotten me interviews for Junior developer roles, unfortunately when I interview for these companies they want somebody with what seems like 5+ years of experience for entry level roles and I haven’t really had much luck landing a job aside from a part time job as a junior dev at a local small company… which I managed to get on my own through LinkedIn and not thru the jobs I’m being sent by the career coach.

Anyways, please share your bootcamp and your overall experience for others to compare."

I’m in my late 20s working as a teacher at a special needs school and want to pivot completely to a software design career. I have *some experience and a lot of lifelong interest to motivate me (and have been doing a lot of research and using Code Academy for practice) but am still VERY much a beginner and obviously need a lot of help.

I’m absolutely broke, but of course am willing to save for the right *affordable boot camp or program, but still really need to keep affordability in mind. I would also need a program that allows part-time and is either based in NYC or (ideally) remote. My goal is to get a software engineering job in the future, so the quality and success of a boot camp is important to me of course.

So originally the first query was meant to be a bridge table to connect to multiple other tables. I'd like to now bring the results for a student in a bridge table to now include it into the 2nd table.

The reason for this is because when I try to bring in the 1st query, the query times out and doesn't fully run because there are millions of rows, where the 2nd one will only use a partial amount of the bridge table to identify.

The first query:

I know that there is a lot of demand for people working in Cybersecurity but will a bootcamp be enough to get hired and paid a decent salary? Is software engineering more flexible and better suited for someone diving into tech as a second career?

Thanks!"

codingbootcamp,"Joined a boot camp, and after one week I don't think I learn at this pace",1667241541,"I guess this is a venting post so only read if that interests you, but I thought of a question at the end (in bold)

So I did all the SheCodes workshops and had fun with it. They're more self-paced though and just CSS, HTML, vanilla JS, and React. I'm sure they don't cover a lot of those, but either way I had fun with it and it was like $1k with a coupon to do them all. But I know it wasn't enough to land a front-end job and many job ads want you to know backend as well. 

So I looked into boot camps and joined one that people on here often rave about. I think it is good and it's full of kind people and instructors, but my brain doesn't appear to be storing what we learn bc I always need help on the graded homework assignments. Things to start to come together a bit but I keep thinking ""if I couldn't do this alone at all, how would I ever pass an interview?"" and I keep thinking that if last week was the first week and more information just keeps coming, am I even really learning to the extent of retaining much information at all? Or am I trying to learn, working with others on daily homework, then mostly forgetting the content learned? 

I'm not sure if that even makes sense but I am thinking about withdrawing and going back to work while self studying or doing Launch even though those options take a lot longer, I just don't think I am going to remember much at the end of the bootcamp if it's just cramming so much info in in such a short amount of time. I understand it's worked for tons of people who do a bootcamp then get a great job right after or within a few months. But I just can tell this sort of thing isn't for everyone and I have the time right now to try one so I wanted to try, and now I'm realizing I do NOT really learn at such a fast pace. And you end up too distracted to eat, get enough sleep, shower, exercise lol. Like sure it's just 3 months but that's not healthy and your health can change in just a few months if you aren't taking good care of your body. 

I don't know the point of my post but I can tell these work well for many but also might end up like me and realizing you don't really learn at this type of pace. Like I feel like information rushes into my brain and then it doesn't stay. I could do most of the first three days assignments on my own but needed help on a couple problems. After that I was just so lost. I can't imagine adding more information at this pace over more weeks honestly. 

**Did anyone do a boot camp then have trouble with the job search bc it was just so fast most things didn't stick around in your brain??**"

codingbootcamp,My thoughts on if coding bootcamps are worth doing,1666844467,"I feel many people in this subreddit who are thinking about joining a bootcamp, ask this question: are coding bootcamps worth doing? My honest answer: **it really depends on you. Nobody can answer this question for you, except for yourself.**

Why?

I want to preface this by saying, coding bootcamps **are NOT a golden ticket** to a software engineering job. These programs are expensive (15 to 20k on average), very stressful, and will take up most of your time throughout the bootcamp. For full time programs, students can spend anywhere from 60 to 80+ hours a week working. This is something that everyone should be aware of when thinking about joining a coding bootcamp.

Coding bootcamps started around a decade ago and have grown exponentially since then. I think this growth is not particularly a good thing, since the market now is completely oversaturated, more noticeably at the entry level. The golden age of coding bootcamps passed a while ago, HOWEVER, this does not mean you cannot get a job.

I completed a part-time coding bootcamp and was able to land a job around \~4 months after I graduated from my program. I worked my ass off in the program and was able to finish in the top 3 of my class. The job search after, I feel was even more difficult than the bootcamp itself. I mass applied everywhere I could, studied hard for interviews and networked as much as I could. All the effort paid off when I was able to land a software engineering role.

Will this be the outcome for everyone? I don’t know. This entirely depends on you, and how much effort you put into working in your bootcamp and after. Work your goddamn ass off so you will have a better chance of landing that job.

Some advice: If you are in a bootcamp now, take advantage of everything that is given to you. If you feel stuck, constantly ask questions to teachers, assistants and your classmates. I would redo all the workshops from scratch to help solidify what I previously learned. I used the Pomodoro technique during studying to be more focused and not get burnt out. 

Hope this helps! Also, don't hesitate to reach out to me, I would love to help out in any way I can."

I realize that there are free options like App Academy Open, but he needs guidance and a structure to follow, and an instructor to teach exactly what needs to be learned and how to learn it with the network as well.

codingbootcamp,The Pedagogy of Codesmith CSX,1666744260,"Hi all,

I don't know if this is being said anywhere, but the pedagogy of CSX is really not grounded in any sort of good practice. 

Solid pedagogy is the ""I do - we do - you do"" method.

In other words:

* Explanation of the theory/concept
* An example
* Ideally, an example of what *not* to do
* Opportunity to practice
* FEEDBACK

Feedback is crucial to learning (see any research paper on effective pedagogy).  

CSX lacks most of these elements.  

Someone else posted: ""There is zero explanation in CSX prep so if you don't go into it already knowing JS you're stuck googling all day which is essentially teaching yourself. To be clear, I'm a self starter, I simply think that if the school is going to offer prep, said prep course should teach you the fundamentals they want you to learn, which their course does not do."" This is my experience as well. 

Now... if the goal of the course is ""teach people how to Google"" -- fine. That's fair, since most coding gigs require this. But then there should be an entire section dedicated to teaching us how to Google, and that should be reinforced throughout the course (e.g. teach us alternatives to Google, how to read through other resources like w3 schools, etc).

The Odin Project is much better imho."

But I’m miserable. I don’t LIKE being a leader. I don’t like having to be the cheerleader, the ‘parent’. I’m an introvert who thrives on deep focus work and 1on1 interactions. I dream of making things, not just roadmaps. 

I live near a LeWagon campus. Web dev coding bootcamp with a solid reputation in France and Canada. I spoke with their ‘recruiter’ and sure I’m a good candidate as with my experience and ‘experience’ (age) you can count on me being committed.

I’m also acutely aware of my age, and that I’d be giving up a long, steady career, as well as income. 
But when I think of doing what I do for another 25 years, I get sad. When I think of learning an actual skill, and growing in that, potentially working on projects (eventually)I truly care about, I get excited.

codingbootcamp,How important was your bootcamp final project to landing your first software engineering role?,1666741084,"I understand there are tons of variables that recruiters evaluate throughout the interviewing process, but for those who have been successfully hired after graduating from bootcamp, I'm curious how important (or not) your bootcamp final project ended up being to landing your first software engineering role.  My guess is that it was a critical component given for most of us bootcampers the final project likely makes up the majority of our portfolio and may be the only project we've ever worked on with other people, but I'd love to understand how much weight is actually given to it relative to other hiring criteria.  What were recruiters most interested in when discussing your final project?  What'd they ask, what did you highlight when presenting it, etc?"
codingbootcamp,Overwhelmed trying to find the 'right' bootcamp for me - any advice is welcomed,1666740021,"Alright so here's my ideals... I recognize there probably won't be a bootcamp that perfectly matches all of these, but just as a guide of generally what I'm looking for...

1. Online/fully remote
2. Some sort of deferred payment plan where I don't get charged until I get a job in the field. I am incredibly tight on money right now and cannot pay upfront.
3. Ideally 4months or less (or a flex-paced work on your own schedule program - I looked at one that was a 6month program but was on your own time assuming you spent 20hrs a week on it so if I doubled that I should be able to get it done in 3.
4. Flexible scheduling/working on my own timeline with check-ins is best for me as I deal with severe chronic pain and working my own hours is ideal, but if it's a strict 9-5 I'll make it work.
5. Major emphasis on them hands on helping you get a job at the end of it
6. Full course qualifies and prepares you to launch into any sort of engineering/software job.  


Thank you all so so much I'm sure this gets asked all the time and I scrolled for a while here trying to glean what I could from other threads but decided maybe putting in my personal hopes will help find the right one for me. Thank you so much!"

So if these kinds of test are a barometer to see if I am cut out for it, then I am not sure I can do it.  Also, I am concerned about  the structure of the curriculum itself  like the course schedule might be too condense for me to truly grasp the material, which is why I am trying to teach myself as much as I can before.

My question is, should I continue with the course and  finish the JavaScript fullstack path? Or should I continue learning what I can till the end of the year, not finish The Odin Project, and join a full time remote boot camp that starts on January 2023.  

I'm currently thinking about going with Tech Elevator as my boot camp of choice. I plan on doing their full time remote program as I don't live near a city for in person sessions.  The next full live remote programs are 01/23/23, 3/6/23 and 5/15/23.

Honestly, I can do any of the 3 dates mentioned above. I just feel some urgency in starting the boot camp and in turn the earlier I can get a job in the field, or be jobless looking for one lol. Any feedback or suggestions would be great!"

codingbootcamp,23 and wanting to get out of current career path and into tech- really need advice!,1666664440,"I’ve been pushed towards the medical field my whole life. I went to college as pre med, just got a B.S in psychology and am supposed to be applying to med schools/ PA schools. But I’ve also been working in the med field and currently have a job at a clinic and absolutely hate it. I strongly dislike the field. 

I’ve always been interested in tech/coding. I’m not exactly sure what sub category I’m interested in or what exact career/job I would want but I really want to get into it (I do plan to utilize free resources to figure out what i specifically want before I commit to any program). 

Looking at this subreddit, I’m really confused on whether I should just get another degree in comp sci, I already have a lot of pre req credits like math and physics (due to my math minor and pre med stuff); or go to a coding boot camp. Some people on here on similar posts are suggesting to get a degree but some are supporting boot camps. I’m just stressed on what to do bc I really dislike my job and want a career change or hope for one.

I also have a fully time job rn and make 16/hr which barely covers all of my bills and I would kind of need to keep the 9-5 5 days a week work schedule to afford my living expenses (I pay for everything my self) so I need to also know in this regard which option would be best. 

I just have so many question about which path is best for me and over all. All input is appreciated!!

I will say I do live in Detroit if anyone has specific programs (colleges or boot camps) to suggest."

codingbootcamp,"Failing in a Coding Bootcamp, now what?",1666575580,"Hi everyone.

Long story short I'm failing to graduate in a coding bootcamp (full stack).

I've got very lucky and won a scholarship to save some money but I will still have to pay the school back even if I don't graduate.

Most students complete the Bootcamp in 6 months and some of them get a job right away.

Unfortunately I had a family member who died and I had to take care of my family between working two jobs and stuff.

What I don't like about this Bootcamp is that the support does not care at all.

The instructor even made fun of me in a classroom because I'm too ""slow"" to complete assignments but I've explained that a family member of mine died so a lot of things happened. This instructor didn't know what to say and said he was just ""kidding"". Ok.

I feel like this is not working for me. I fall behind and I'm not getting any support from the instructors. Nobody cares. They just care about my money.

What should I do next?

I don't want to give up programming.

This Bootcamp has been the worst experience I've ever had including all my family stuff that happened where I had no control.

The Director of the school keeps telling me if I graduate I will still get a job. Most students are still looking for a job after a few months they completed the Bootcamp course.

So If I complete the Bootcamp I should be able to get something back and still have to pay the loan back.

If I dropout I won't get anything but still have to pay the loan back.

I feel like a complete failure and I'm ashamed of not being able to complete this Bootcamp at this time.

What would you suggest?

Thank you for your support."
codingbootcamp,App Academy- is it truly worth all the fuss?,1666570449,"I've gotten past the non-technical interview, and am having issues with the assessments. My one-on-one didn't guide me in how to improve my css (I failed 2/4 assessments because I got one line of css wrong) and instead sent me a link that I already read and couldn't entirely understand. They're hyper focused on Mac OS so they ask that you download programs from github instead of from the websites (like Node, or Python).  
I've heard mixed reviews:  
\- yes it's a good bootcamp and has a high hiring rate  
\- no it's not good and most people get jobs that pay as low (or as high) as $30k a year.  


At this point I'm thinking of stepping back and learning from something else.  


I need mentors that are more helpful, etc, but if no that, then a free learning program.  


My background: college dropout (had to get a fulltime job to help my family), 12 years in sales (not really impressive, considering).

Yeah, I'm as bland as they come. I've decided to work in software developing or engineering because it interests me, not only as a hobby. I know that wanting to work this field isn't for the light of heart or people who want to avoid stress or eye strain.

I've heard that the Odin Project is great, but I'm not sure if companies hire based off self taught. I'm sure they want a degree or certificate.

codingbootcamp,Questions for Tech Elevator and Hack Reactor grads,1666557285,"Hey folks, I have been considering a career change into software dev for about a year. 

A little history: I started working at my family print shop right out of high school and have about 10 years of customer service experience but no college degree. Earlier this year I started working through The Odin Project and while I enjoyed the material, I had a bit of trouble self-studying and keeping myself on a schedule. I am in a position now where I could take time off to devote a few months entirely to learning and am most seriously considering Tech Elevator and Hack Reactor.

For grads of these programs, do you believe not having a college degree would seriously hamper my job prospects after graduating?

Also I am a bit concerned about the Hack Reactor schedule. I know some people who have completed the program and they recommend it but the 12 hours a day, 6 days a week schedule really worries me. I’ve been out of school for a decade and I’m not sure I could keep up with such a rigorous program.

Little bit of context - I did my undergrad in music, and have worked as a piano teacher / gigger for the past 10+ years.  The money is actually pretty good (I tend to gross \~90k, but then there's self-employment taxes, health insurance, etc.), and I care about what I do, but with a growing family, working almost exclusively nights and weekends is decidedly not good fit.  

I feel a bit overwhelmed, because when I look at job boards, I I'm 99% sure I don't have any of the skills, the resume, or the certifications to replace my current income with a more traditional 9-5 job with benefits.  A couple people have suggested coding to me, but I have no clue where to start.  A couple questions: 

1) Are 12 / 24-week coding boot camps a legitimate option to landing a good job upon completion?  If I start down that road, study hard, and apply myself, can I have confidence in having  in-demand skills and being able to change careers, or am I just kidding myself and will find myself having a hard time compared to younger people with full 4-year software engineering / computer science degrees? 

2) What boot camps are most worth actually considering (i.e. not scams, have proven track records of job placement, etc.).  I'll read more on the boards here, too. 

3) Are there particular ""tracks,"" skill sets, etc. that are going to lead to more hirability, better salary, and more upward mobility in companies and moving between companies than others?  Again, this is something I need to read more about, but any guidance on what to pay most attention to (i.e. full stack vs. front end vs. back end).  

4) What salary could I reasonably expect to actually earn starting out?  I have a feeling that even if I landed a job, I'll be taking a pay decrease, but if it allows for more stability, better work-family balance, and opportunity to advance in career, maybe it's worth it.

I have some questions about the 19-week hack reactor program.

Are their tests proctored and timed, or are they more relaxed with it (do them at your own pace). I am more concerned with being tested than putting in the work. I can retain information fine, but under pressure for me is difficult.
2. Is it hard to get admitted into the 19 week program? I have an unrelated degree from a great school, but just self taught coding experience.

I just recently graduated from a bootcamp and I learned that the instructors were saying that they have never seen a cohort be so active in helping each other out and just how much a team we were together. Which I honestly found very surprising as it felt like it should have been something normal.

&amp;#x200B;

See a classmate asking for debugging help? Don't be afraid to throw your hand in and help them out! You will be reviewing someone else's code which, guess what, you will be doing all the time once you get job.

&amp;#x200B;

Explaining things to others and helping others debug is a great way to really extend your knowledge on the subject and just better understand it in general.

Your classmates are also potential connections that you just don't want to throw away. One day the bootcamp will be over and you will lose the daily support the bootcamp was giving you. But if you stay connected with your classmates then you can still work together after the bootcamp. Make a discord, make a slack. Perhaps make some kind of daily/schedule together where you work through leetcode or make a project together. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Use your classmates as much as possibly during and after the bootcamp. They are a great resource even if you all have the same amount of programming knowledge."

I want to become a Front End Developer. I'm not really that interested in back end. I have a few questions.

1. Is it possible to climb the Front End ladder (senior/team lead etc) without learning substantial back end material (I know a little is needed)
2. Is it worth taking a bootcamp that is full stack if I want to get into Front End? (15-20k cost). If not, what do you suggest?
3. If I get a entry level job by self-studying - will it prevent me from rising through the ranks if I don't have a degree/bootcamp experience?

Thank you"

codingbootcamp,"Rutgers boot camp, can I get a job and is coding viable",1665940663,"Hello everyone. I recently got my master's in social work and am in a local union steam fitting / pipe fitters NYC group. I'm burnt out from construction and want a change in my life. I need advice, as I'm scared to death of changing my life. I want to attend a boot camp, I've looked into Rutgers here in the tristate area and it seems to be the best bet. But do people get jobs after boot camps? I fear Im not going back to get a four year degree in computer science, and really need some advice. The Rutgers software engineering program is 6 months and roughly 12k dollars. 

I have severe anxiety and manage it well with meds and therapy but this is alot. I'd love to hear what people say. My girlfriend made a point in that a highly reputable university would not have a boot camp that sucks as it would sully their good name and college reputation. Thoughts?

codingbootcamp,Generation USA,1665756766,"I'm currently taking the AWS Cloud Practitioner bootcamp through Generation USA, and I'm not really liking it. I'm considering if I should drop it or not. I'm also doing another bootcamp for Full Stack Development which I'm honestly more interested in. I signed up for the AWS one just to have it under my belt but I've read mixed reviews on the usefulness of the practitioner cert. 

What I do like about the program is that we have access to A Cloud Guru for free and get a free voucher for the exam. 

What I dislike about the program are the mandatory zoom classes. Now if we were actually going over material that would be fantastic, but the large majority of these classes are dedicated to soft skills and behavioral mindset scenarios that I'm just not interested in, and at this point I just dread having to attend class because of how boring these activities are. I've been taking the course in mid-late August and we probably only talked about actually material 2-3 times. 

Although I do like A Cloud Guru I feel this is on par to a Udemy course or something. Should I stick it out or drop it so I can focus on Full Stack? The full Stack course just started but I'm sure it will be ramping up."

codingbootcamp,"Formation, Week 3 Thoughts",1665721118,"Since I’ve received a decent number of messages about my last review (here AND on LinkedIn, clever those of you who have connected those dots, I was not expecting a message ""I saw your post on Reddit"" LOL), and I have now completed my first “Challenge,” it is time to post an update.

So, the first challenge I was assigned is “Algo Blitz.” The expected timeline had me finishing at week 4, or October 21, but I just passed the final subchallenge today, and so I’ll be moving on to “Algo Marathon.” To be perfectly honest, before I began the program I could only solve a small handful of LeetCode Easy problems. I had a little bit more success on Codeforces Rank 800, but still not much.  
 Now, after just three weeks, I can actually reliably solve LeetCode Easy and some Medium. I actually find the algorithmic challenges fun, when even just a short time ago I found them super daunting. I just applied for a job at Cisco, and prior to a few weeks ago I would only have known how to solve one of the problems, now I could solve them all with plenty of time remaining.

Also, coming up I have a resume review with a career coach, as well as a few mock phone interviews. So that will be really nice practice.

Things I like about the program:

· The live sessions. The sessions are normally broken up into small group (normally about 4-5 of us Fellows, plus a Mentor), or into a one-on-one session between two Fellows. I can read and watch videos about different algorithms all day, but what really, truly helps me understand them is being able to verbally discuss them with other people and this is such a huge help. Since the group sizes are so small, everyone gets a chance to actively participate.

· Speaking of the Mentors: most of them are active employees at Google, Amazon, etc. They have real insight into what is required to work at top tech firms.

· Which leads to, networking. Not only do most of the Mentors work in top tech firms, a lot of my co-Fellows have also been actively working in the industry for some time. Not gonna lie, there was a part of me that mentally fan-boyed when I recently had sessions with employees at some of my favorite gaming studios. There are a few of us coming into the program fresh out of boot camp without ever having worked in the field, but it seems like most have decent backgrounds.

· Also, the  platform. Honestly, the learning platform is really intuitive and easy to use and really helps keep you focused.

Things I do not like (but appreciate):

Oh my god, I’m so tired. Like, my bootcamp said it was going to be time-intensive, and I’m sure for a lot of people it was, but up until the final project I was able to get all my work done on Saturdays and almost ignore it other than our one session a week. I’m actually really used to spending less time on a task than would take most other people (thus why I’m so much more productive than any of my coworkers at my current day job).

With Formation, I do have sessions basically every day that I do not have blocked off. When I’m not in a session, I’m constantly either studying or completing assignments or practicing on LeetCode or AlgoExpert or any number of other things.

I say I don’t like it, but truly it is great. I haven’t been this challenged by anything in a long time, nor have I ever felt this much improvement in such a short amount of time.

Anyway, as I complete future challenges, or if my opinion takes a surprising turn to the negative, I’ll be sure to post updates if people continue to be interest, but for now I think this program really might be as good as advertised. Of course, the real test will be whether it helps me actually get a decent job, lol, but either way I feel more confident in myself now than I did before."

Yeah, I can understand what each individual part does, but I don’t know how to put it together correctly.

. How should I improve from here. My next &amp; final interview is also a pair programming one. 
```
Thank you for taking some time to chat with our team again. I wanted to follow up with the specific feedback that was discussed from your second technical interview.

Improvements from your first interview:
- JS Fundamentals - you demonstrated a very solid understanding of a number of native JS functions and fundamentals, including pass by reference/pass by value, closure, recursion and array methods.

- Problem Solving - you demonstrated a strong ability to solve problems with code using conditional logic, loops and JS data types.

- Thoughtful Communication - you caught yourself and apologized on a few occasions where you started to navigate the problem while still in the driver role while pair programming and asked me if you need to slow down while communicating your approach.

Areas for continued growth:
- Technical Communication - When you communicate your approach you tend to talk faster and it gets harder to follow. Due to the accent you have coming from India, it will be extra important to communicate slowly and methodically to keep your partner on track with your thinking. To your credit, you have already identified this and asked me if you should slow down. It would also be a good idea to omit technical details like which array method you would use during your high level approach. Leave the technical details to the driver to implement the way they choose to.

- Pair Programming - You obviously love to code and like solving hard problems. You will need work hard to refrain from taking over the navigator role while acting as the driver. It might be a good idea to actually stop trying to solve the problem on your own so that you can just focus on your partner and implement the strategy they are thinking of. There were a few times where it was hard for me to coax you into trying something I was thinking of because you were also thinking of your own solution.

- OOP - Continue to develop an understanding of OOP fundamentals.

codingbootcamp,Advice on career change – Coding Bootcamp vs Master’s degree,1665598392,"Hello All,

Please bear with me as I longwindedly explain my current predicament and need for advice. I also realize this may not be the correct sub, so you are welcome to recommend more appropriate ones if needed.

**My background:** I have been in healthcare for about 20 years. Not on the front lines, but working at a corporate headquarters handling quality improvement, KPIs (key performance indicators), federal regulations, things like that. I dealt a lot with the technical and analytical folks and worked closely with them to design reports and QA results.  I had a great job and was well respected and highly paid. I was in a leadership position. I got laid off last year due to a company takeover and quickly scrambled to get something, which ended up being in the government healthcare sector.  Nowhere near as in depth or technical, and I no longer have a worthy voice or opinion.  I also took a huge pay cut. I’m just a lowly analyst now.

I absolutely positively hate my job and the company I work for.  But I cannot seem to get a new one no matter how hard I try. I have applied for hundreds of jobs and reached out to any contacts in the industry for positions similar to what I had before, even lower-level ones, to no avail. It appears that my skills are just not transferable, probably because I do not have formal training in anything important (note: I am college educated and have a Master’s degree).   

**Back to the point:** I have always been interested in data, data analysis/analytics, coding, programming, testing, data mapping, data validation, software application development, etc. I have no formal experience with any of it though. But, I have been involved in it all for many years. I have worked with others that create queries and reports and I know enough to be able to sometimes QA the code to expose an issue.  This would include SAS, SQL, R mostly. 

I know I am very detail oriented and have been told by multiple people in this line of work that I would be great at it, and I agree with this. I can describe how a report should function, what data sources/variables/specifics are needed, how they are connected, and can also determine where the problem is if the report comes back faulty. But, I can’t write code or read it fluently.

I want a job where my primary role is related to data analytics and/or coding, digging into the code of an existing application and making updates, performing data validation, quality assurance, mapping different data sources, or building something from scratch. Also developing reports or enhancing existing ones.  Something along these lines.

The first problem is that I don’t even know what a job title like this would be called.  Data scientist? Developer? Software Engineer? Not just a data analyst. I need a higher paying job and am certain I can handle it. What would a relevant position be? My experience has been exclusive to healthcare clinical data but I don’t want to necessarily limit it to that.

**End game:** I realize I need formal training. Not just because I am switching career avenues, but also because I literally cannot find a job with my current skillset. 

I want to make sure that whatever education I choose is teaching me the right skills, for one. And it isn’t just a crash course that I won’t retain.  I need something that is basically guaranteed to get me a job, a good job, after graduating/becoming certified/etc. I don’t want to start at the very bottom. As I said, I have some experience already, just not direct/formal.

So now the main question is, given all of this background, would you recommend a coding bootcamp or getting a Master’s Degree in something technical. (I already have an MBA and that got me nowhere, career-wise). Please do not suggest self-teaching. I need structured learning, I need a mentor, a teacher, classes, homework etc. I cannot just do it alone. I know many can, but not me. It's not my learning style.

If you recommend a Bootcamp, can you please go as far as indicating the specific company and what the bootcamp should be in? Is a bootcamp from an accredited university better than one of the other companies like CodeSmith etc etc etc I don't even know the names of most of them.

If you think getting another Master’s degree is better, there are a lot of options for different programs (general Computer Science, software development, data analytics, and so on), so I don’t know which schools are actually reputable for this kind of thing. Nor do I know what the degree should specifically be in, in order to get the job I am looking for. 

I am desperate for advice. I really wish someone could \[accurately\] say “Oh you need take these classes, get this degree, do x y and z, and then you can apply for these types of jobs”.  **I need a very clear path to getting the job I am describing above**, which I assume includes education and training of some sort.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you all so much."

So I decided to leave a d part of me regrets it deeply because I should have pushed through but I’m out 16K and I do know most of the basics. I’m at a point right now I don’t know how to proceed. Do I self teach? Even though I struggle with focus and attention or do I find another bootcamp but they’re mostly 16K or above from the ones I’m seeing.

codingbootcamp,Why you should not join Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Bootcamps in my personal opinion and how to be wary of predatory bootcamps,1665551341,"Even if you simply do the math , you need 1 data scientist for every 20 developers or even the ratio is even more skewed sometimes, unless your product is heavily ML driven.   
Other than that these fields are to a greater degree Gatekeeped. Lot of folks for frustrated Stem Majors , who have huge contextual experience with data(Engg Phd's, Dev Econ folks, consulting analyst pivots).  


You will most likely be only considered for analytics positions, for which honestly ML is an overkill, what could get you employed in 3 might very well end up taking 9  
Analytics/BI mostly consists :  


Python/R  
Some Specific Libraries according to use cases.  
SQL  
Tableau/ Power BI  


The smarter approach to ML/Data Science careers would be be a developer for 2 years then transition to ML , you won't be gatekeeped by resume, you will have developed self teaching skills by then &amp; you can come back to development if you dont like ML anymore(this might not be possible if you start with , you might end up getting Silo'd)  


Another Approach might be to learn Data Engineering/ Cloud Developer Roles. This is also creates sufficient room to experiment and provides a greater degree of job security.

Otherwise folks might add their opinions to this and might think differently but this is what i feel is the realistic view of the market.  


This post came to be after reading Codesmith's newsletter on how they are beta testing a Machine learning and DS bootcamp.  


You have to understand all the bootcamps dont have YOUR best interests in their heart, regardless of they reputed they are. They are focussing on this HUGE WORD THAT GIVES STARTUP BROS BONER : ""GROWTH""  


They need to keep getting more people every year than the previous, for that they need to keep making new products(courses/programs) in this case. You are very much the Guinea Pig in these Bootcamps. Also when bootcamps state that their grads are big tech and other companies, they never mention whether that was immediately after the program. A bootcamp grad making it to Walmart after 3 years of working post completion of program is not the optimal representation of a bootcamp outcome and they are teaching you.  


This selling Shovel &amp; picks in this gold rush is getting way over the line. You should immediately without exception assume anyone selling a course are pushing their motives, regardless of how much a selfless &amp; guidance giver they sound.  


  
Many of us have never had professional experience or are too naive despite having one. We always need to ask "" What's in it for them? ""  


I intend to write a post on how to self learn while checking whether you are actually learning pretty soon(though it wont be from a ""I did it so you can do it too"" perspective but ""here's how I fucked, pls don't do this"" perspective)

&amp;#x200B;

You can find some github repos of mine in post history that might help you in learning for free/job hunting.

But I do not have the money saved nor can I get a decent loan at the moment, but my parents have agreed to put me up rent free while I do a bootcamp and job search. So as far as bills and opportunity I would be okay, and still making more than before even with an ISA as scammy as they can be."

All this talk of doom and gloom for those of us who are trying to get their foot in the door with the impending recession, is very depressing. 🥺  


Maybe there's something wrong with my application process as I haven't gotten any calls for interview. So I want to ask the people of this subreddit, who were successful in getting their first job - What is it that you think you did that got you an interview call?  


I've a bunch of other questions too.   


1. Any tips regarding the kind of projects that I should be working on that can get me noticed?
2. Any tips for networking?
3. Which job boards did you all use while trying to find companies that are more willing to hire bootcamp grads with no prior experience?
4. My tech-skills include - Javascript, React, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, git/GitHub. Should I be learning and adding  new languages/tools to my list?
5. My prior work experience is not at all related to tech. Should I still include it on my resume?

I'm so confused and I really don't know what to do now. I've used up all of my savings, so I'll have to find a part-time job to sustain myself.  


I'd really appreciate it if you all can shed some light on this and help a fellow bootcamp grad out by sharing your experience.

This is for a career change to be completed while I keep working full time. I have looked into Coder Academy too which got great reviews on reddit but not an option for me at the moment.

codingbootcamp,App Academy Bootcamp Experience,1665412847,"Pros and cons based on a subpar experience below. Saw a recent one that outlined mostly cons, and one after linking that post with mostly pros. Not joining a debate or taking sides, to each their own. Going to link stuff on both sides to show that if online stuff is believable.

Reviews online?: I've seen mostly positive reviews on Course Report, SwitchUp, CareerKarma, and LinkedIn with mixed reviews on Reddit, YouTube, Yelp, and Google Maps. [There's going to be bias on both sides from online sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy7kdz/comment/irg3jmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

CIRR?: [going to relink this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy7kdz/comment/irg3jmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) because explained it well, CIRR may have bias, but tries to be transparent and ya App Academy doesn't do it but neither do other large bootcamps like General Assembly.

Software engineer job after?: Yes and [others have noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/comment/irfr2r4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) alumni do get some sort of tech job after graduation and had a positive experience. Ya their partnership jobs aren't only software engineer jobs, and ya I know some who've returned to old jobs after or have been laid off as others have said. Probably not unique to a/A or coding bootcamps. And people can get engineering jobs after.

Curriculum quality?: pretty subpar and didn't match standards you may have for the price of tuition or college quality imo. I'm [not the only one to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/nmyp17/currently_avoid_app_academy/) [this on sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that have mixed reviews like Reddit, Yelp, YouTube, Google Maps, etc but [others have noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8slqh6/comment/e270dgi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that for them they were satisfied on those very same websites and ones with positive reviews like Course Report, SwitchUp, etc. Ya a curriculum person was fired in the past for the online program but its probably not unique to a/A as a coding bootcamp. There were typos but there's probably typos in online curriculum other places. There was a module or two that were iffy with stuff that sometimes didn't work but others weren't bad.

High deferral rates? Assessment difficulty level?: ya they can be tricky to pass. They provide study guides and on some weeks they seemed to prepare one better than other weeks imo. They've [been noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xjfg6c/comment/ipb4tzi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to have [high deferral rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/comment/irgzzpf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hq473/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hrw4y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) but [some are](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/ti3981/past_experiences_with_app_academy_needed/) [down for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjwqk4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). To each their own.

Cheating issue?: [maybe most online school programs](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjyngb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) not just coding bootcamps have this issue, but ya App Academy did from my experience and [recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irq7412/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [have mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app) this. Seen it mentioned on other websites. Ya they could do a better job of switching assessment versions between cohorts to help prevent this from people who're on both sides. But I've heard its not as bad for in person programs.

Staff?: there was a mix of both alumni and non-alumni with diff levels of experience or education, but ya all TAs were alumni and most cohort leads or mod leads were alumni tho were a few non-alumni. Mix of alumni and non-alumni for roles like career staff. Probably not unique to a/A.

Post-program a/A: my career coach wasn't an alumni but some classmates friends had alumni career coaches. Its mixed. Mine was nice and respectful but one of my friends wasnt and left a/A shortly after. Its been noted online theres high turnover with their staff yet isn't unique to a/A as a bootcamp. They do make you apply to a certain amount of jobs per week otherwise you'll get a strike like while in the program. But they reset your strikes if you have any once you reach graduation. They do review your resume though it wasn't much different from tips you can find online or college career centers but if you're new to resume writing its helpful.

Would I recommend them?:  no. Some of my classmate friends would and some wouldn't. Probably not unique to a/A its like this for any coding bootcamp. Looks like [I'm not alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) since a former TA staff said the same.

Admissions staff sales-y?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I saw the Glassdoor link on how there's a noted bonus or commissions aspect to their role. I saw their admissions staff on LinkedIn with the sales descriptions, awards, previous sales jobs before a/A, sure. But don't know how 100% Glassdoor or LinkedIn. 

Biased alumni? Linkedin, Reddit, etc sites chat?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I've seen the points that there's survivorship bias or not, that ones who post on LinkedIn for them are gonna be positive since you're prob not posting something negative. Had an interviewer who was an alumni even and explained he took them off of his resume and LinkedIn after a few years of work experience. Maybe if one had a bad experience they wouldn't note them either. And ya you pay a lot of tuition $, I can see how a negative on them can be like a negative on your skills for getting jobs. But reaching out to alumni even if some sort of bias or mostly positive is still going to be helpful anyways.

Customer complaints? Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education? Better Business Bureau?: ya but probably not unique to a/A. Tho I'd never heard of these two so that was new to see. [Here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1415032_mod.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516032.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf) n [here](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/specialty-schools/app-academy-llc-1116-889911), tried to read the 1 complaint listed on last link but rn it's a 404 page so idk.

Lawsuits?: ya they've had several recent lawsuits in the past years. That was new didn't know that before. But there were small payouts as [others noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Maybe not unique to a/A or for-profit education companies/schools. 

Parent company?: ya their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc. But other companies do this even some big tech ones.

TalentMatch?: new to me saw that [in one of the recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Wasn't mentioned during admissions process or as an alumni or student but idk it could've been in the contract and maybe others know about it. Could also not be unique to a/A and maybe other coding bootcamps have this.

From what I've seen recently, anticipating that people will argue or link this post but gonna hop off now. Best of luck everyone"

codingbootcamp,Looking to enter into software engineering as a beginner. No experience. Career changer. Bay Area,1665376865,"Are programs like IBM Full Stack credible?

Thank you 🤞🏿"
codingbootcamp,Cost of Living,1665366849,"Hello, I live in Colorado and have wanted to make a career change for the past few years. Software engineering has appealed to me as a good alternative to what I’m doing and I know that it’s an intense undertaking. I’ve self-taught off and on and realize that if I want to make the breakthrough and actually get a job in tech, I need to be consistent and produce projects. I’m still debating continuing the self-taught route and just refusing to step away when I encounter an obstacle, which is what has been holding me back, or immersing myself in the fire of a boot camp, which doesn’t give me the option to step away and provides a valuable network. 

I’ve narrowed it down to 2 boot camps: Turing and Skill Distillery, both of which have good reviews. Turing is 7 months long and will increase their tuition to $25K in January, which will make them the most expensive boot camp I’ve seen and Skill Distillery is $20K for 4 months. The thing that has been nagging me over the tuitions, though, is cost of living while in these programs. Beyond the program I have to consider months of job hunting full-time. What’s the best way to approach this? One of Turing’s finance partners offers an $18K cost of living loan and Skill Distillery has an ISA option, but I don’t see a cost of living loan option, although I’m sure I can find one. Also, although I like the idea of being in a longer program with Turing, that means I have to be unemployed that much longer, which means potentially close to a year without an income. Even with 18K to help, that would be pushing it even with my savings, which I’d rather not take to the brink of nothing. 

I’m ready to make this career change, but I need to figure out the best way to support myself financially while attending a boot camp. Has anyone moved back home with family to do this? That would involve me going to Georgia, where there’s a 2 hour time difference and I’d rather go to a boot camp in the state I plan on looking for work.

Alternatively, I could just get more disciplined with self-teaching. I’m currently on my first big project on The Odin Project (Landing Page) and have enjoyed the curriculum so far. Honestly, this path would be ideal because I could keep working while I do it. I just need to get better at approaching projects and troubleshooting. I know I can figure it out!

How did you approach living without a job while attending a boot camp? Did you just save up enough for the duration of the boot camp and a few months after? Take out a loan? Move in with someone? What are your opinions on the 2 boot camps I listed? Another question I have is do you feel that the move to a remote teaching model has made boot camps less valuable? I’m hesitant to pay $25K for a remote program, even though the feedback is good. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!"
codingbootcamp,What is personally fulfilling or satisfying about software engineering?,1665359023,"Say you get into bootcamp, work really hard, and pass with flying colors.

You're now in, officially as a software engineer.

So now... what? 

What do you do as a software engineer -- working for the big tech cos. -- that is fulfilling, or satisfying, or gives you a sense of real accomplishment beyond just securing a high-paying job, and telling people, ""hey everyone, I work for a big tech company""?

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp for CS not Web Dev.,1665312493,"I don't know of any bootcamp that teaches foundational CS topics. All of them teach you a bunch of frameworks for web dev, but you get students who honestly don't have a clue about what the computer is really doing.

Imo a bootcamp that lasts for 1 year, that charges 40-60k is sorely missing (maybe ISA over 2-3 yrs). Here's why:

1) A programmer with good CS fundamentals will out perform even the best programmers who have no CS knowledge. (knowing react isn't that valuable. Knowing CS is)

2) College is the only place to go to learn CS in a timely manner unless you have ungodly autodidactic abilities. Literally no alternative. Many SWEs who don't know CS do eventually learn a lot of it over years and years of experience, but even then they have gaps in their knowledge and it took them way longer than four years.

3) College bundles together a ton of stuff (education, social life, prestige, a degree, etc...) but many of us just want the education.

4) Anyone who  masters the fundamental CS topics over a year long 60 hours a week bootcamp will be way more knowledgeable about CS than the typical college grad and have not much trouble finding a good job and moving up very fast."

codingbootcamp,Things to Consider Before a Bootcamp (a/A Grad),1665260973,"Here's what I would've wanted to know before choosing a bootcamp, as I recently completed a/A's 24-week curriculum and regret it (long read ahead:

* **Curriculum quality and experience** let's get into the reality: most alumni are incentivized to say great things because they've paid \~$20,000 to $31,000 and undermining them undermines their skills. Despite me being an alumnus, I'm going to state my experience and what I'd recommend for others to look into when considering bootcamps. In my opinion, the curriculum quality and experience was worth half the cost and you pay to teach yourself essentially. That's my take.
* **How sales-like their staff really are** prior to you paying or signing a contract to enroll, such as their admissions staff. For example, App Academy's admissions staff earn bonuses or commission past base pay. I verified this during the application process by asking an admissions staff who even once called me on a Saturday during the process. But he assured me that they ""weren't doing anything wrong"" despite earning some sort of commission/bonus in addition to base pay as admissions staff, I think related to the amount of people they get to sign an a/A contract but idk. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/App-Academy-Admissions-Specialist-Salaries-E759554_D_KO12,33.htm) seems to reflect this too for those roles at App Academy so do some looking around on Glassdoor for admissions-like staff at whichever bootcamp you're considering too.
* **Whether they rush you through the application process**. For example, with App Academy I was interested in applying for a date that was \~1.5 months out. When they responded to me, they let me know a sooner date to join was actually available at the end of that month in \~2-3 weeks but had an orientation Zoom meeting a bit earlier. I ended up having the take home ""project"" of html/css, IQ-like test, video interview, etc. and contract emailed to sign all in a span of like 1.5 weeks in order to make an orientation Zoom meeting for this earlier cohort. I kept stressing it was fine if I didn't finish the process in time by this magically sooner start date, and personally felt rushed to finish anyways by it instead of the later one. This meant I had no time to seriously look into or apply to other bootcamps and I wonder if it's a strategy used. And I was sleep deprived by the time a very long contract was sent to me to read through, which also didn't have text searchable -- mine was more like image files where I couldn't *control + f* for certain words.
* **Yelp reviews/public review websites**. Know that companies can maybe\* can influence\* Yelp (I assume) to hide 1-star reviews or reviews containing certain contents. I tried leaving a 1-star Yelp review 3 different times so far for a/A and each time Yelp has made it not public within a few days. From this experience I think that it's fair to be skeptical of other purely review-based websites, especially ones dedicated to bootcamps.
* **Whether they've ever participated in** [**CIRR**](https://cirr.org/). For example, App Academy never has.
* **Whether they're regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education and the reasons why they were**, how many times they've been fined and for what reasons, and how they went about resisting being regulated by them initially if they did. For example, A/A resisted and was fined some more after officially regulated by them, yet ironically includes it like a badge that they're a school and regulated by BPPE now. Interesting note: a/A was caught not verifying students/customers high school transcripts/diplomas or college degrees and they also didn't disclose job rates for alumni or any data like that.[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation\_1516032.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516032.pdf)[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation\_appacademy.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_appacademy.pdf)[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy\_ord.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf)
* **Whether they've been reported to the Better Business Bureau**. App Academy has had complaints reported to them 2x at least in recent years (but they've already removed one from being publicly visible online in the past few months)
* **Lawsuits**. How many, what were the reasons (if you can find out why online), how recent they were. For example, App Academy has had four lawsuits between recent students/customers and them at least with filing dates in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc so you wouldn't see it unless you looked up their parent company.
* **Whether the bootcamp has a parent company**. App Academy's is Hash Map Labs Inc. I think this is important since some information during research may not be easily discoverable unless you look into the parent company that the bootcamp belongs to.
* **YouTube videos**. Look at recent ones and their comments, decide for yourself. Though keep in mind some may incentivize alumni who happen to be influencers or YouTubers in some way to make a review on them, or that's what some speculate anyways.
* **Gender ratio** of student body and staff. For example, App Academy's student body was about \~85-90% male and \~15-10% female and is the case on average for them. Noting in case user cares about this type of experience.
* **Class size**. For example, App Academy's online one started with 100-120 people in mine and reduced down to \~45 by midway through, which somehow is about average for their online cohorts and maybe in person too (each cohort seems to have on avrg about 30-40s despite larger initial start number).
* **Who their staff are**, such as educational ones (instructors and TAs). Alumni of the program mostly? App Academy's was for most of their educational staff in my experience, even for some of their non-educational staff roles like career coaches. Sure, some of their educational staff may have been former teachers themselves, but they still have 0 experience as a SWE/SDE despite maybe being a former English or whichever subject teaching background prior to being an alumnus of the program and becoming an instructor.
* **Bonus**: if you've recently finished a bootcamp, know people who are in one, or etc. I suggest doing a test of applying to jobs for a few weeks without the bootcamp on your resume and compare with a few weeks of when it is on yours. When I graduated from a/A, I did this test the first few weeks where I didn't put a/A on my resume. Instead, I kept that education section portion vague and said I completed a certificate program in SWE/SDE (since technically a/A issues a certificate of completion). I got the same number of interviews, phone screens, and take homes as I did when I later put a/A on my resume. But note that I had a college degree in a semi-decent subject from a decent school (with a good gpa, scholarship, award, some science/math courses to list), about a year of good work experience as well as work experience while in college, and 3 ""impressive"" portfolio projects that a/A didn't really help me make.

Also wanted to add in that I had my post focus on things that didn't seem as accessible or shared before here on Reddit since it seems like you can find people weigh in with their experience already in multiple posts or comments. This post is already super long. If people really want, I can append a few more paragraphs on my experience specifically, I'm not against that or avoiding doing so. I just chose to prioritize other points that seemed rarer to find here."

codingbootcamp,Which free coding bootcamp is best?,1665259036,"I'm nearly finished with the Python for Everybody course by Charles Severance. I'm really liking what I'm seeing and it's making sense, so I'm wanting to take the next step. I can't afford a bootcamp just yet, so I'm wanting to make do with the free resources out there. There are three that stand out to me: App Academy Open (old), App Academy Open (new), and The Odin Project. 

I've heard that App Academy Open (old) is better than new in the fact that it teaches Ruby on Rails instead of Python like App Academy Open (new) does. And I've heard a lot of people praise The Odin Project, but have also heard that it's based off of App Academy's program. 

If I had to pick one of the three, which is likely the best and most relevant to today's job market?"

codingbootcamp,Verifying the accusations levied against App Academy in the recent post on this subreddit,1665237675,"Just a reminder to do your research. It's easy to look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/) and see a long list of red flags. But it's not uncommon for someone to have an agenda beyond what's being presented.

The entire post presents exactly *ONE* valid and substantiated concern regarding App Academy: they are not part of the [CIRR](https://cirr.org/), a small nonprofit that regulates advertising and stat reporting for a number of coding bootcamps. This  is a legitimate piece of info to be aware of when it comes to considering App Academy as your choice of bootcamp.

Meanwhile, let's talk about the other proof provided. One link to Glassdoor shows that App Academy's recruiters get paid commission for signing up a new customer. I'll just leave that alone because hopefully the common sense of that fact speaks for itself and doesn't need a link to Glassdoor in the first place.

After that there are three links showing that App Academy was fined $50k once for violating an Approval to Operate in 2015 (which they have clearly since rectified), and that they were fined $7k once for not verifying an insignificant number of applicants' high school diplomas and not formatting their paperwork correctly. Hardly a smoking gun.

Then there is a series of unsubstantiated claims like App Academy is removing reviews, removing reports to the BBB, and only hiring alumni. Nothing to back any of that up, just someone saying words on the internet. After that, the four lawsuits filed against them are brought up but the details are left vague. I wonder why?

Let's look in to those lawsuits. One resulted in a [payout of $450](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-a-delaware-vs-matthew-corley-526533), another was a [payout of $370](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-vs-rayyan-ahmed-528093), the third is once again a [payout of $370](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-a-delaware-vs-brian-kang-528088), and the fourth is a [workers' comp settlement](https://trellis.law/case/cgc19575170/samorn-selim-vs-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-et-al). Nothing here to so much as raise an eyebrow at.

But why would someone go out of their way to slander a bootcamp they attended? Perhaps some insight can be gained from the comments of the post, where two of the OP's classmates felt compelled to [speak up](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/irfvhm5/) calling out OP's cheating (which OP tacitly [admits to](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/irg10x2/)) and the fact that OP was a personality conflict within the cohort.

Meanwhile, who am I and why did I go out of my way to make this post? Just a current student of a/A (Aug 2022 cohort AKA best cohort) who is thoroughly enjoying the program and didn't like seeing it slandered. Hope you all have a lovely day."

Since a lot of people have different experiences with bootcamps and seeing a nearly 100% satisfaction rate raises a few red flags for me. Not only that I found that a lot of graduates from the LW bootcamp seems to be working for them right after their courses and I hardly think that their prices are justified if the teacher are the same people that just graduated the bootcamp, without prior experience and a proper degree. What is your opinion.

codingbootcamp,Advice wanted,1665166945,"I am feeling a bit lost and was hoping for some advice/input on what my next step should be.

I started coding in July and have been working on JavaScript/html/ css modules on FreeCodeCamp and code academy. Most recently I have been doing Angela Yu's bootcamp on Udemy and also CSX (the Codesmith prep program). I am feeling like I am experiencing a total lack of focus(learning but in a very circular, inefficient manner). To complicate things, I also have started learning Python as well to prepare for a potential bootcamp interview. 

So here is my conundrum....I am not sure if the bootcamp route is right for me or if there is another way to become a developer. I have been staying home for the past 2.5 with my son, and I do not want to basically ""disappear"" for three months. I think I should be ready to go back to work by the time he goes to school/ daycare full-time (possibly a year from now or a bit longer). Luckily, I am not under the same time pressure as some other people wanting to break into tech, but it does feel like a Catch 22 in terms of gaining momentum/ motivation. But perhaps since I would be on an extended time frame, I could avoid paying a ton for a bootcamp . I have no qualms about paying for education and could probably scrounge up the eye-popping expense of most bootcamps but am pretty skeptical.

A little bit about me... My previous background is education, and I was most recently  in a ""teacher leadership"" position. I am in my early 40's and have a couple of masters degrees (one in education and another in a social science). The reason why I am not planning to return to education is that I feel like it is really a dead-end for me in terms of career progression and compensation. I love logic problems, being creative, and learning/ gaining expertise in something. My previous position was extremely educational technology heavy, and I am obviously passionate about that.

So far I have checked out all of the ""likely suspects"" in terms of the bootcamps, and I am still feeling a bit skeptical. Some, like some of the ones affiliated with some universities, have major scam vibes. Others that offer private loan or ISAs also sketch me out a bit. The ones that kick people out midway through are a ""no go"" from me. I used to be an adjunct professor at a for profit university, so I might be a little more aware/ paranoid about these practices than someone else. I also think I have a different perspective than I would in my '20s and would like a program where I can maintain some balance in my life(is this even realistic?).

Would I be better off paying for continuing education classes at a university? There is a JavaScript three course sequence at a university near me (for under 5k I think). Or choosing one online program(like TOP) and fully committing? What about the UPenn online MS in CS program (it is ""only"" 20k more than a bootcamp, but would you come out with better skills)?  Maybe Nucamp although there seem to be varied outcomes?

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading these ramblings. Anyone in a similar boat? Or completed a bootcamp with a toddler? Any suggestions are welcome."

I checked it out a few times over the last year or so. Leon seems like a super nice guy. I watched a bunch of the videos. I've done some of the assignments. I've seen how the discord works. I've spent some time with it. There are certainly some interesting ways to keep people engaged.

There are a lot of people around here recommending it - even though they haven't done the school themselves. I get the feeling that people who went to a pricey boot camp aren't that enthusiastic about paying back their loans - and kinda have that feeling (now that they already know the stuff) - that they could have learned it for free with #100devs. Is that true? I haven't met anyone who's gone through the whole thing (yet).

I'm curious to hear what students have to say and to see their work/outcomes.

I have been in the medical field, but after being fired, because I had to take time off to take care of my son, I would like to make a career change and become a software developer. Here are my criteria for a bootcamp: Less than $2k, FSWD, self-paced but I can ask questions if I am struggling, 1 on 1 guidance and career guidance in the future. Studying on my own is not a good fit for me, as I need accountability and guidance as I go through the program and I can't do scheduled classes because my son also takes a lot of my time and can only study when he's asleep.

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp or University?,1664995705,"Hey there everyone! I want to get some advice in what path I should take. 

I have a B.S. in CompSci from a state university that I got in 2015. (7 years ago so I’m a tad bit rusty so to speak) I’m currently working full time as a tool and die maker and am looking to go back to “school” and make use of my Bachelors degree. So with that being said I will continue working while taking classes so I need part time night classes / weekend.

Also, after reading posts on this sub it looks like the the top coding boot camps are:
Hack reactor 
Code smith
Launch school
Are any better than the other in terms of coursework, price, employment advising, success?

Since I already have my BS would it better for me to get my MS in Cybersecurity or to do one of the boot camps listed above? The fully online MS program I’m looking at is through Quinnipiac University in CT. I feel like having a MS under my belt and on my resume will help me land a better job. 

Thanks in advance for any advice"

codingbootcamp,Codesmith vs 100devs - how to decide?,1664974074,"In a recent post about self-taught vs bootcamps, 100devs was mentioned as a free self-taught bootcamp option. 

This is the first time I had heard of 100devs so I did some research. People are extremely positive about it on other programming and JavaScript subreddits and it has a large discord server. 

This brings up the question of the value of paid boot camps vs 100devs since 100devs is a free online bootcamp and some of the participants are landing good jobs. 

What is the value of a paid bootcamp over 100devs? I imagine the graduation rate of a free bootcamp is extremely low but the cost is significantly more attractive and it can be done part-time. Paid bootcamps like Codesmith offer rigor, camaraderie, accountability, job support, and verified outcomes for ~90% of graduates.

How does one decide which route to take? The fact that the 100devs instructor is a GA bootcamp instructor put me on watch based on GA reviews and outcomes I read about here. 

I’m currently deciding whether or not I should do a bootcamp after spontaneously meeting a number of successful Codesmith grads. Is dedicating 3 months to a bootcamp and paying $20k worth it? If Codesmith cost more, would people still feel the same way?

I imagine 100devs is not an adequate alternative but some think it is. Why or why not?"

codingbootcamp,San Marcos Extended Learning Full Stack Web Developer with MEAN Stack,1664900511,"Hello! 

I am looking for advice in terms of the path I should go down to learn Web Dev. I was recently laid off from my last job about two weeks ago and I am looking to make a career change. I should receive about 6 months of unemployment so I think that should hold me over until I have to start digging into my savings.

I started working on Angela Yu's Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp to get a feel for development, and I am currently wrapping up the intermediate CSS portion of the course. So far I am enjoying it but ultimately I am using it to learn Web Dev material until I figure out which bootcamp I want to attend.

Alternatively, I found through CalJobs education services, they offer courses and certifications for Web Dev but they are slim pickings. I landed on a really interesting program through California State University San Marcos called ""Full Stack Web Developer with MEAN Stack (I'll link it below). What really caught my eye about it is that they offer what they call an ""Externship Opportunity"" which they will essentially hook me up with free work with one of their partnered employer's so I can do about 40 hours of unpaid on the job work after I complete the course work. To me this seems like it could be an excellent way to go my foot in the door with a company and also add work experience to my resume. I know certs dont mean much in this field but it does seem to be a fairly comprehensive course covering MEAN stack. Additional, I believe I would qualify for **Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Training (WIOA)** through CalJobs which would effectively pay for the program.

Program:

I am curious to know how you all would weigh the  40 hours of ""work experience"" and the education the course provides over one of these bigger bootcamps such as, GA, CodingDojo, Codesmith etc..

If anyone else has done something like this, can you let me know how your experience was so I may make a better informed decision?

I appreciate the polite and constructive feedback!"

codingbootcamp,Simplilearn is a SCAM. Avoid at all costs!,1664832988,"This is going to be a long read. Let me start from the beginning:

I graduated with a BS in comp sci a year ago. As my graduation was near, I figured it would be a good idea to expand my knowledge and skillset and learn blockchain development. I did some googling and came across Simplilearn's ""blockchain development BootCamp"" which apparently collaborated with CalTech. Obviously I seemed too good to be true but after some googling, I came across thousands of 5-star reviews and high Trustpilot ratings on this company, so I went ahead and send an email for possible enrollment.

This is where it gets interesting. The next day I received a call from one of their managers who was curious as to why I wanted to enroll. He then completely forgot about trying to actually market his company and he kept pushing me to pay now. Each time I would say I will consult with my parents first he kept saying ""Oh yeah of course but I'm sure if you tell your parents that this course is so important and will do nothing but good for my career so my parents have to be pleased. Also if you pay today the course will be discounted for you."" This was the number one red flag for me as it seemed like nothing but another one of those call center scams. I told him I will give him an answer soon. One day later I sent him an email saying I no longer wish to enroll in the program because I can clearly tell this is just a scam to pay for a useless course. 

Here is where the real problem began. Every day for the next 3-4 months ever since I informed him MULTIPLE times that I do not have interest in their scam, I would get at least 3-4 calls from the SAME woman at Simplilearn asking me why I don't want to be part of their program. I informed them at that point over 100 times that I am employed now and I do not care for the program and she would reply with ""okay I will remove you from the list."" Lo and behold the next day she calls again and again and again. At this point, I would pick up the phone and annoy her until she hangs up. I would block their numbers and they would still manage to call me from another number. 

After some time I stopped receiving any calls. It's been 6 months and today I got a call from an unfamiliar number. I immediately regretted answering the phone the second this moron spoke. He introduced himself as being from Simplilearn and that he came across my ""portfolio"" and that he wanted to see if I was interested in some ""scholarship"" program which was another bs course. I informed him that I am employed at a good company and do not wish to enroll in any course. He kept pushing to get information from me and get me to enroll in this course. I kept listening just so I can waste his time as I know this is all a bunch of lies to scam money. As this moron kept rumbling on, he mentioned that ""my employees have informed me of how impressed they are with your portfolio and that you are an outstanding programmer"". I stopped him from speaking at that point as their employees don't know a single thing about me and informed him that I do not want to be part of his damn course. Now, I'm sure everyone here has seen youtube videos of scam callers insulting the ""customer"" once they don't get what they want. This genius decides to respond to me by saying, ""I'm sorry that you are not smart enough and don't want to move up the ladder in life"". At that point, I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I never knew a full-stack developer is ""not smart enough"" for their scam course.

To sum it all up, AVOID THIS SCAM. Trust me, they will take your money and if they don't they will annoy the living shit out of you. The number is 415-430-9684 for anyone that has gotten pulled into their spam calls. Might as well block this number because Professor Moron is gonna be calling you sooner or later."
codingbootcamp,Bootcamps are not a golden ticket,1664820278,"This is a semi copy paste of a comment I made on a post here. But people need to realize that a bootcamp alone is not going to get you a job in tech (especially right now, companies are cutting devs with the economy in free fall).

Things to consider before you ask ""How many jobs will I get after XYZ bootcamp is done""

What's your tech background?

Do you have a degree?

Do you have any applicable job experience?

How old are you?

Do you have a portfolio/GitHub with projects you'd want recruiters to see?

How's your people networking skills?

codingbootcamp,Is coding bootcamp right for my circumstances?,1664756286,"I started college in Fall 2018 as a biology major, pre-med track. The summer of 2020 made me realize that I've been ignoring my tech passion, so I switched my major from Biology to Business Admin / Computer Information Systems at the beginning of my Junior year. That was the only tech-related major my school offered. So I had to work as an overtime student as I had to cram in all the business and CIS courses into 2 years. There were 2 programming classes that I had to take, which I basically BSed my way through, as I didn't have enough time to take them seriously due to all the other courses. So my knowledge pretty much stopped at for and while loops by the time I graduated in May of this year. I took a job working as an Information Systems Trainee, which was basically because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but still get paid pretty well ($52k in a relatively low COL southeastern state). The position is mainly desktop support and network admin type work. But I decided to try again with programming, and started taking Python for Everybody by Charles Severance (also called Scientific Computing with Python on FreeCodeCamp). I found that the concepts aren't as difficult to understand as I thought, and am finding the problems relatively easy. I'm almost finished with the course, and am really liking programming.

Last week I decided to try and attend Codesmith, I was attempting to get into the next part-time cohort which has a deadline for the technical interview about 3 weeks away. I've begun to do 'CSX' which is Codesmith's required prep course for applicants.

Prior to even considering a bootcamp, I was learning JavaScript by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. While this has been good, there's a lot of topics required of the technical interview and CSX that were either simply not in that Udemy course or only briefly touched upon.

Was able to get thru the first couple modules of CSX without much trouble. But now I'm at the Callback functions module and I'm starting to feeling lost. 

I work 40 hours / week and even debated taking PTO to prepare, but not sure I'll have enough time.

codingbootcamp,Starting First Coding Job Tomorrow and Filled with Dread,1664737081,"Hi Reddit! So I did the whole shebang - got myself enrolled in a bootcamp, did the bootcamp, sent out hundred of applications and finally got that first job. What's bothering me now is....I'm absolutely terrified to start this job tomorrow.   


It's a pretty big deal first job and I'm honestly not at all sure how I managed to land it. I'll be working as a Full Stack Dev (they know very well that I only know front-end languages) with people of extremely high caliber that I'm intimidated by. Kind of irrelevant but also not: not only will I be the only woman on the team, but I'm a young, pretty, feminine woman in my 20's  (and Reddit can flame me for this but I only mention it because it's a stark contrast with the rest of the team). I have a nose ring, I wear a lot of makeup, I like to dress cute, etc. etc.  


The rest of the team are ALL older, clean-cut, ex-military buzzcut type guys. Practically the entire company is retired military (I'm def not). It could possibly be the most homogenous group I have ever witnessed. The ones that I've met throughout the hiring process have all been super friendly but I'm still so afraid of making that first mistake and I'm having a lot of fears about having space to grow in this role and in this dynamic.

Within my roles I have supported programs from inception to sustainment with requirements, interoperability, design, testing, governance, modeling, ect. I think these skills would translate well into Systems Architecture. However, I have no IT experience and have not coded since undergrad. My role has always been adjacent to the coding/dev. I think I may be able to overcome the IT experience but most architect job posts require coding experience.
     Would a coding boot camp be a sufficient in place of 1/2 years of coding/software dev in my situation? I’ve considered free courses but would I really put those on my resume? Or would a boot camp with a more official certificate be more appropriate? 
     I’ve pretty recently finished my student loans so I’m not looking to tack on anymore debt. If a boot camp is appropriate are there camps less than a few grand that could provide the weight to my resume to be able to transition?

codingbootcamp,I hated my coding bootcamp (CareerFoundry),1664589805,"I just want to preface by saying I am pro bootcamps. There are definitely good ones out there. The one I just picked I just despised and had to drop out. I dropped out 7 months ago and decided to become self taught and got a Software Engineer job a couple months after. I just wanted to rant, and maybe someone who was considering this bootcamp won't like the way they do it either. I'm sure some people like it, but this is why I dropped out. Maybe if someone is looking at it and reads this, and doesn't like what they see, they turn away. I completed well over half the bootcamp so I think I can speak on it.

How this bootcamp works. On each technology there are reading sections. They take about 30 mins to an hour (lets assume theyre all an hour for this post). You have a tutor that checks your work, and mentor calls for your liking on your schedule.

Let me address the elephant in the room: The amount of shit they feed you in 3-7 months (Based on how fast you finish). This is off the top of my head (There's probably more lol): HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, Jquery Node.js, Express, JWT Web Token/Auth, React, Redux, Unit Testing, Angular (Seriously... This framework is super intricate. Why did they throw that in with React?? Seriously, they spent a whole 5 hours on React). It took me months to learn React to be viable for a job. EVERY lesson is an hour of reading. They had 5 lessons for React. React and Angular (especially) are WAY too complex to understand anything in 5 hours without prior experience. On top of that, I can't learn well by reading mostly.  I prefer audio / visual. If you only spend 10 hours (10 reading lessons) on Javascript you're also no where close to understanding a framework like React or Javascript in general. They spent no time on Data Structures and Algorithms either.

The positives. I don't want to sound bias, there are good parts. The mentor system was great. I had 3 good mentors (had to get new ones because 2 of them quit lol. One said it was because they are underpaid) and they gave good feedback and industry advice. I basically scheduled them like once or twice a week. The projects were good to learn on if you actually could soak any information. I can understand the code now, but at the time I was lost. Aside from the overload of information, they do ""teach"" you the popular and hire-able technologies. They offer resume advice which I haven't actually done, but if it is a good system it would be definitely useful. 

Anyways thanks for reading. If you have questions let me know."

\*If you want to do in-person, you will be asked to show up 2 days a week at the office (LA or Irvine office only, parking is not free) watching videos there.  


The instructors are simply not that good and they don't really care about you (a lot of them are former students), missing guidance or instructions.   


You are basically watching videos and learn it by yourself (I can do it free on youtube, or Udemy, edx...)   


If you have questions, you are going to get on the que and wait for 30min to an hr for them to answer you (and the answer is either too short for you to understand or misleading).   


A lot of students have to work with each other or look up online videos for help.  


At least 1/3 of my class wasn't able to graduate because of lack of instruction, the class is too demanding...  


and beware of Co-founder Gregorio when you interact with him. If he doesn't like you, or you get into an argument with him, good luck... he will find ways to fail you and kick you out while keeping his money.   


It is not just me. It happened to a lot of veterans. Look up reviews on coursereport (sort by most recent) and you will find out Sabio is not that good. They spent a lot of money on marketing and fake reviews."
codingbootcamp,"Formation.dev, Week 1 Review",1664564510,"Hello everyone.

So, I applied for Formation a while back and got waitlisted.  Thankfully, I ended up hearing back from the same week I recently got [laid off before I even started](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xkghc6/got_my_first_job_two_weeks_after_bootcamp/).  Taking that as a sign, I committed and signed up, I officially started this past Monday.

Since I've only been there one week, I obviously can't speak as to the full program.  But I can say over the last week, I have met a lot of phenomenal people, among both the fellows and the mentors.

The first ""course"" I'm working on is what they call AlgoBlitz, and as it sounds, its just focused on getting really good at algorithms and data structures.  There have been a lot of things I've encountered this week, that I knew, but I didn't know I knew, if that makes any sense.  There have been a few times where if I was presented the problem on my own, I'd freeze up and have no idea how to proceed, but working on it with others has been a great help at actually applying the knowledge I already had to the specific problem.

It is pretty intense.  I had sessions every single day this week, and have had to code something every day and will definitely need to do so on weekends as well.  At my bootcamp, we only met once a week and I could get most of the work done by just kicking ass on Saturdays.  Definitely can't pull that off at Formation, or at least I certainly can't.  Maybe someone can.

Also, most of the fellows I have met actually work in the industry, which is cool.  I don't know what percentage of fellows have no real experience like me, but I do seem to be in the minority so far.  One of my co-fellows works at Obsidian, which is cool and a bit of a dream to me.  If nothing else, the chance for networking here is much better than I likely would get on my own.

So yeah, that's my thoughts after one week.  I'm really enjoying things so far.  I was a little concerned when going through reviews originally (does seriously no one have anything negative to say?! For a bit I thought they must all be paid and fake), but I think I can believe it now.

I'll post more as a I know more."
codingbootcamp,How would you want to be supported as a woman attending a coding bootcamp?,1664562253,"I work for a coding bootcamp called [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=womencodingbootcamp), which specializes in super small class sizes and a really high quality, high touch educational experience. We care a lot about community and inclusivity, and we always want to make sure our students are having a positive experience.

Specifically, we want to do more to make sure our students who are women have all the support they want or need, as a bootcamp is an intense experience and of course software engineering is still a primarily male field and can feel unwelcoming for women.

Some options we've discussed are matching our women students with women advisers, as well as inviting them to join a women-specific channel in our Slack community. I also like the idea of planning a month event for the women in our community (current students, staff, and alum) to have candid and safe conversations. For those of you who are bootcamp students or grads, or anyone else with insight to add, what else would have made your experience better both during bootcamp and beyond?"

codingbootcamp,"With so many beginners here (myself included), can someone with experience explain the state of the job market?",1664557856,"Every day there are posts from people looking to make a career change, which is great! Every post then has comments warning OP about the job market, trying to make it clear that getting a job after bootcamp is HARD and that the job market is saturated, job market is crazy right now, etc. 

Now, we all know that bootcamp grads coming into the job market can fill a variety of types:

* Well prepared, motivated, aggressively looking for jobs
* Good skills, but no networking ability
* Went to questionable bootcamp, comes out with questionable skills
* Some come to bootcamp with preexisting BA/BS/MA/MS degrees and have better luck than others
* Made it through bootcamp with mom and dad's money, doesn't really do anything after and these people tank published outcomes sometimes
* Has expectation that bootcamp will handhold and offer them a job, then finds out they were wrong
* Etc, Etc

Can someone who has time and experience in the field explain the actual state of the job market? Is the market really that bad? Or is it just like any other field where jobs don't grow on trees and, surprise surprise, you actually have to put in effort to get the job (but, put in the effort and work and yes, you will be rewarded with a job). I see a lot of doom and gloom over the state of things, and I am trying to figure out if what I am seeing is due to something inherent in the industry or if it's just another example of what's happening in most job markets in general right now. 

So for those with time and experience in this field, how would you accurately explain the job market for new grads? Is it actually that bad, or are people just surprised to learn that just like in any other field, you still have to work hard for a job? If it is that bad, is this like a pendulum type-thing where eventually the pendulum will swing the other way and outlooks will improve? Or has the industry changed forever and the job prospects for new graduates will likely continue to diminish? Thank you in advance for any insight and experience you can share!"

Doing a remote, part-time Bootcamp in order to launch my career as a software developer in 2023-2024 is what I'm after.

I've read your posts and spoken to a people that have recommended Hack Reactor, Launch School, and the likes. They look like just the thing I want.

However, since I'm not a US resident/citizen, I understand that it's more difficult to find payment options such as ISAs; the up-front costs are potentially out of my budget. Any recommendations?

I am a math and science teacher and I am looking to change careers after 5+ years of experience. While I am not bored of my job, I am needing and wanting change especially now that I my wife and I starting our lives together. My salary as a teacher will not cut it for the both of us. My BS degree is in biology but did some C++ (object oriented and intro to data structures). Right now, I am learning the absolute basics of Python. I am having a blast...In fact, C++ was one of the most fun times of my college years. (FWIW, I absolutely adore mathematics...my favorite thing in academia.)  

I am looking to enter into the tech industry as a web developer. I realized that my golden ticket is joining a coding bootcamp of sorts. I would LOVE to get a CS degree (BS or MS) but time and finances are simply not with me right now.

I am not looking to make six-figures right away but would like to be able to do so after 2 years of experience. I hoping to make at least 70K. (If I were single, I would not care how much or how little I'd make in the short-term.)

&amp;#x200B;

Which bootcamp would be best for me? 

* While I have basic programming logic down, I genuinely do not have experience outside of college courses. 
* I am keeping my full-time job to fund this program. Hopefully, I get a part-time program...ideally, weekend programs...at the very least, the synchronous live (online?)-classes should occur in the weekends. (My daily shift ends at 3PM)
* I am located in Los Angeles. 
* Hopefully something budget friendly...errrr.... not looking forward to dumping 15K USD into this. If it must be done, then I will. 
* I am looking for a bootcamp with high hiring rates at genuine dev/SWE/etc. jobs not clerical/random job at a tech company. 
* I do not know why but I would prefer having a certificate or something to show that I did something. 
* Does backing from a big-name university hold any water? (Cal-tech Simplilearn, UCLA Trilogy, MIT x-Pro) 
* Is there a better camp if I do ever decide to enter into an MS in CS degree later on? 
* Is there any particular pre-emptive knowledge that would be great for me to know?"

codingbootcamp,Coding Boot camp experience Toronto,1664395159," 

Hey guys.

I am 34 years old male and interested in changing careers. Can anyone here give me an insight of how much you can get paid with good professional level skills gained from Coding Bootcamps? I am thinking of attending U of T SCS Coding bootcamp in Toronto. Here is my Educational and Professional History:

I already have a Bsc. from University of Toronto in Biology. The degree pretty much had no significant value unless I wanted to go for med school which I didn't. Then I stumbled upon CAD design which I loved studying and currently have a pretty decent career with 8 years of experience out of which 4 years are of project coordination. I am currently getting paid 70k plus overtime and bonuses. However, I am not too satisfied with my job and feel like there is a solid upper end salary cap in this career. On the other hand, I started online marketing as a hobby a few years ago and liked it. But I always wished I knew how to code so I could customize my pages. Then I thought of why not learn code from scratch and build it a career. I tried a few online coding classes and I didn't mind doing it all and feel like I can be pretty good at it if I learn it more professionally.

Can someone share their experience of changing careers to Tech? How do you feel about it? Is the pay rate good? What kind of companies actually hire you - start ups or the big guys? I am looking forward for your responses."

codingbootcamp,What language should I learn to build some basic tools?,1664221459,"I want to do some basic coding in order to build some basic tools for myself...

For example, I'd like to build a web-scraper to gather information for my real-estate business.

I'd also like to build a tool to help me do some language translation (take old historical documents in Greek, Latin, etc, and create a dropdown menu for each word where I can choose the best translation of that word in that context)

And probably similar other ideas that I come up with periodically. I've played around with coding enough to be confident that I could learn a language if I pick one and find a bootcamp or course to go through, but I'm not sure which one is the best language for what I want to do."

Coming here in hopes that I can get some advice on which direction to go - I'm completely new and NO KNOWLEDGE of coding whatsoever. However, I can pick up quickly and enjoy obsessively learning new things. I enjoy working in the remote space, and am at a point in my life where I really need to teach myself a valuable and relevant skill to make me a desirable hire for stable, fully-remote work which allows me higher earning potentials. I have wanted to get into some form of coding bootcamp, or coding courses to learn, obtain certificates, and be able to start the job search from there for the right company to land on.. 

Does anyone have advice on what certificates are most valuable? What should I be aiming for/where to start? Any advice on legitimacy of the bootcamps/online training courses?

For full background, I'm a single parent raising a kiddo and would prefer courses available online to do at my leisure when he is asleep hopefully, I study hard and become obsessed with new skills until I master them so I'm not scared to put the work in but want to put it into the RIGHT avenue that will give me the highest value and also in a reasonable amount of time from starting point to the time I could confidently apply to jobs. I'm open to any suggestions, and grateful for all feedback!"

codingbootcamp,I went through Galvanize and wanted to share.,1664182855,"I want to post here about my experience in case it's helpful to someone.

I majored in History, but I took a lot of different classes at the university I was at. I took to first two computer science courses and really liked them and did okay but I stuck to History. After I graduated I kept up an interest in programming. Self teaching is a skill I didn't really have at first but I learned after college by doing my own little projects with no intention of trying to make a career in tech. I learned HTML and CSS and I learned Python and C. I read a book about computer processors. I actually taught myself quite a lot and, more importantly I learned how to teach myself.

In 2018, six years after graduating from college, I decided that my career wasn't really going anywhere and I started at Galvanize (that was before it was bought by or bought Hack Reactor. I don't understand the business side of what happened there). It was a great program and it was very different that what Hack Reactor is so I can't speak to that.

The program was not terribly difficult for me in terms of content because I had taught myself a lot going in. I did work very hard, though, because they were teaching a lot of things I hadn't learned and because I really wanted make sure I fully understood everything I was presented with. I was one of (or maybe the most) prepared students in my program. I already knew how to program and I knew some basics about how the web worked. I met a lot of people who did not have much experience programming at Galvanize and many of them did quite well. Knowing what I knew going it was definitely helpful but not necessary.

When I finished I decided that three months was a realistic time frame for getting a job and that I could start really panicking if I didn't get a job by then. I got a job after a couple months (everyone who finished the program I was in got a job within six months I believe, most within three).

I was offered a job at a startup where I negotiated an 85K/year salary. I think I could have negotiated higher but I didn't really know what to ask for. Since then I have gotten multiple raises and promotions and am not a ""Senior Software Development Engineer.""

I think that good Coding Bootcamps can provide you with a path into the industry, but they don't really give you everything you need to know. From my experience, though, CS degrees don't either. I work with a guy who went to the same university as I did and who has been in the industry for the same length of time who is far less equipped than I am to contribute as a software engineer. It's an industry that will definitely take a chance on you if you made it through a program but it's also important that you are interested in the field and are motivated to keep teaching yourself. You can't just walk out of a Coding Bootcamp knowing everything you need to know to be a fully contributing software engineer (again, a CS degree is kind of the same) but it might give you enough to get a foot in the door if it's something you have a genuine interest in.

I thought of myself as an apprentice when I was hired and I think that's a fair way to look at it.

I still work at the company that initially hired me. They are vocal about not wanting me to leave, and have really tried to keep me. I have worked hard to be valuable, and it feels good to work for a company that recognizes that. The salary is not the most important part of the work to me, feeling like I am an important member of a team and really feeling like I'm getting better and better and being an engineer is much more gratifying. As cheesy as that is, it's one of the things I could not find outside of the tech industry.

That said, having my salary climb faster than my rent isn't anything to sneeze at either.

If anyone has questions about doing a coding boot camp I am happy to answer them with the caveat that I am me and you are you. I know that going through Galvanize was a very good decision for me but I don't know if it's a good choice for you. There were definitely people in my program who could not get through it. Of the 16 people in my cohort, five did not make it through.

I just wanted to share because I've seen a range of questions and experiences here and I thought mine might be helpful."

3) what was your background before coding bootcamp?
4) what tech stack did you use on your bootcamp ?

n)………. They are many questions like this everyday.
To be honest and transparent , I have seeing people spend thousands of dollar for a bootcamp that have fake reviews and end up didn’t have a career fulfillment.
I really want to build a platform where people could be completely  transparent , honest about their history , background before and after the coding bootcamp.
This platform will rely on others people trust.
I really want to build something truthful and honest.
Feature I will build for the mvp
1)- build a review feature where people could add review
2) build a user profile where they could share all their background and history 
3) build blogs and tutorials section where people could train before attending a coding bootcamp 
4) real time chat with other bootcampers graduated 
5) connect student with a perfect bootcamp 
6) job board to allow users and companies to apply for job and post jobs.
7 ) meetup features where bootcampers could meet either online or in person

codingbootcamp,Preparing for Coding Bootcamp,1664050835,"Hi everyone, 

I recently started coding with no prior experience and no knowledge of tech and am looking to join a bootcamp. I was learning python on codecademy and Udemy but shifted to learning JavaScript since that's what most bootcamps teach.

I really want to join CodeSmith's December cohort but I need some advice since CS is really hard to get into. I've been trying to follow the advice said on other posts about prepping but now that it's already the end of September I'm getting nervous that I won't have enough time to prepare.  
I'm currently doing CSX (or trying) and freecodecamp. I'm enrolled to start CS's JS for Beginners followed by CS Prep. I want to take Colt Steele's course on JS but I'm waiting for it to go on sale.

Is there anything else I can do to be able to learn better and faster? Not to sound arrogant but I thought I had relatively great critical thinking skills until I started learning how to code. With coding I feel like the more I learn the more I don't know and am now realizing that I'm really not the brightest crayon.. It's a little discouraging because I would get stuck on loops or array questions on CSX for hours/days and it's taking me longer than I expected to even finish the precourse on CSX. 

Even though it's difficult this is the first time I've taken interest in something enough to actively pursue studying so any advice is greatly appreciated!"

codingbootcamp,A Review of Two Stride-Owned Bootcamps (Hack Reactor + Tech Elevator) in 2022,1663796622,"Throwaway.

**TL; DR** \- I applied to Tech Elevator, but wasn't accepted and was kicked out of Hack Reactor about 9 weeks into the full-time program and less than a month from the finish. My experience as an autistic person with ADHD is that they are both ableist cesspools and have very little interest in accessibility beyond DEI branding optics. They each have a very corporate, impersonal, rigid, CYA approach to handling accessibility concerns and disability accommodations which ultimately made it impossible for me to continue.

I was kicked out of Hack Reactor last week well into the second half and applied to Tech Elevator early this year. Long post below for those interested in the gritty details.

**1.** **Tech Elevator**

I filled out the online application form, which was pretty short and not to difficult to navigate. A couple of things that did give me pause right away though were that the gender options were ""man"", ""woman"", ""transgender"", and ""non-binary"" (with radio buttons), and the fact that admissions were just based on a behavioral interview and timed aptitude test. These weren't deal-breakers for me, but felt a bit sketchy, especially since they make a big point on their website to be all about helping those ""underrepresented in tech"" get a leg up and this already gave me the impression that they just cared about the look of doing so. I also eventually noticed that they have an asterisk next to their main blurb about ""underrepresented in tech"" to specifically point out ""people of color and LGBTQ+"", which was also a bit of a red flag for me, but I fit into both of those groups, so I theoretically would be allowed to apply, so I continued doing so anyway and figured there was no harm in just applying and seeing what happened. 

I got sent a link for the aptitude test and not having been informed that it would be timed, I clicked the link. I panicked a bit when I saw it was timed since I have never shined that way and had accommodations to get 50% extra time from college and high school, but decided to just do my best. It had some basic arithmetic, algebra, and logic puzzles. It was all stuff I knew how to do, but I felt like I didn't have enough time to show my true capabilities. Much to my surprise, my score was good enough despite me not even finishing half of the questions in the time allotted and I was invited to the behavioral interview and to take a longer-form aptitude test. 

Knowing what the test was at this point and having been told it would be the same format after asking, I requested 50% additional time and submitted my most recent neuropsychological evaluation report. In other situations where this had come up, I was given my extended time with zero fuss. However, the staff at Tech Elevator decided to refuse to give me this accommodation and told me that if they were to do this, then they'd have to also ""do it for everybody in order to be fair"" and that ""the system didn't allow it to be changed for just one person"". I also had let them know that in the behavioral interview, I might demonstrate some mannerisms that could throw them off and all I received as a reply was basically, ""Thanks for telling your story"". Nothing felt amiss in the actual behavioral interview itself from what I could tell and I tried to muscle through the second aptitude test. 

I also went to an info session and asked the facilitator how they approach the idea of neurodiversity. The response was, ""All software engineers are a little socially awkward, we've seen a lot of that"". No Karen, being a ""little socially awkward"" is not the same as having a developmental disability.

Not more than a week later, I got a rejection letter and was told I could reapply in six months. When I asked for some feedback, my interviewer seemed taken aback and gave me this oddly long-winded response about how they're, ""following in the footsteps of other educational institutions by not disclosing application details to the applicant"", that had all kinds of rambling assumptions about my disappointment that I never expressed to them.

**2.** **Hack Reactor**

Now I assumed this was a completely separate boot camp that was just owned by Galvanize and had to do some digging much later on to find out that it was indeed owned by the same people who own Tech Elevator, since Stride owns Galvanize. A family friend who had FAANG experience in addition to being an entrepreneur and who had a CS degree strongly recommended it and spoke very highly of colleagues he had worked with who graduated from here, so I assumed it would likely be good to go.

In the beginning, they really did seem to handle things a lot differently than Tech Elevator. They gave me extended testing time for both the aptitude test and the TAA with no protest and with swift approval. I was also excited about having the option to pick a track (Remote Full-Time) which did not require any kind of behavioral interview whatsoever, so I could just study concrete technical skills without as much possibility for abstract and fuzzy social issues that I had no control over getting in the way. When I didn't pass my TAA the first time, they gave really great feedback and set me up with two Laser Coaching sessions, which went above and beyond my expectations. I passed the TAA on my second try.

I enjoyed completing the pre-course. The staff for pre-course were very responsive and helpful in office hours and it seemed to me like they expected a lot of fundamentals and rightfully so in order for prospects to actually make it into the bootcamp, since it was all definitely necessary material in order to get anything done during the actual program.

Enter the Immersive. The first week, things didn't feel quite right, and in hindsight, I gave way too much benefit of the doubt and overanalyzed my gut feelings. After all, my family had so generously gone into about $18,000 of debt on my behalf, I was three years out of college never having never worked a full-time job before, and had already submitted job applications numbering in the 100s to no avail, along with two failed rounds of grad school applications. I was also being pressured by healthcare providers to go on SSI, spend down my savings, and live with my parents the rest of my life, which was something I absolutely did not want to entertain. I was ready for something to change.

The first red flags for me were in the Student Wiki and in the overall attitude exhibited by my cohort lead, which consisted of spouting a lot of toxically positive self-help mumbo jumbo about ""growth mindset"". The Student Wiki had rules such as writing ""warm and friendly"" emails without explaining what in the world that actually means and told us that we needed to ""exhibit appropriate eye contact at all times"". As someone who has been punished more times than I can count over not making eye contact and for seeming ""aloof and robotic"", I found this clearly suboptimal. There was also a little blurb about the opportunity to apply to be a Resident later down the line which stated that applicants must be ""a people person who takes initiative to implement palatable social programming"". I booked an office hour with the Cohort Lead to explain my concerns. I was told that what I had read wasn't what I had thought it was and that all I needed to do was have my camera on and not be doing something else 20 feet away from my device without letting them know I was leaving my desk for a little while, which was something I could easily uphold. We were also told to ""just connect"" with our cohort. When I asked for help with strategies doing that from staff, I got ignored.

I was also nervous about the emphasis on test performance and the midpoint test being something one could be thrown out over, given my lifelong issues with test performance, but was reassured that it wasn't the only factor under consideration. I also emphasized how I have almost two decades of trauma from school that I didn't want to add to, but was told to, ""stay positive and see this as a new experience"".

I briefly considered switching to the part-time program, but I was not given the information by the enrollment advisor who explained the difference between the two programs to me, that the full-time program is a huge feeder of disabled students into the part-time program, and that the leadership for that program is far more aware of the accessibility issues we face. Those were things I found out by finding alumni on my own later down the line and reaching out to them after I was hanging on by a thread.

I decided to give it a go and decline the Mulligan option, feeling unsure about it all. I felt like I needed the structure after spending months trying to self-teach, that this was one of the more rigorous bootcamp options, and that I did not want to go back for a second bachelor's.

The issues started to pile up. First, I was told that I was ""unfocused"". It was never explained to me what this meant to the staff, but it eventually ended up in my PIP later on as an ""improvement goal"". My guess is that it had to do at least partly with their other complaint that my communications were not ""concise and deliberate"". I reiterated to them that I do not make eye contact like most people and move around a lot and that this actually helps me focus. I fully disclosed my diagnoses after it seemed like they weren't getting it. They thanked me for the explanation, but ultimately didn't care (though pretended to).

Then I got told that my questions during lecture were ""irrelevant"" with no concrete feedback on how to change this other than to ""use context"" and ""think before you speak"". Eventually, I got told that I was to only put my questions in a designated Slack channel (which got ignored most of the time so I stopped and went back to asking the way I did before) and that I needed to make sure nobody else was unmuted and count to 5 before unmuting myself. Other students with ADHD asked for lectures to be recorded to which the response was, ""No. Pay attention. Recording the lecture hurts student engagement"". 

Other students privately told me that the dismissiveness of our Tech Mentor toward me on a singled out basis made them very uncomfortable and hesitant to participate in class or kickoffs. Overall, I had a much better experience with other students than the staff, especially in our Discord server, which was a bit of an open secret (They don't like it when students just start groups with other students with no staff oversight. They really didn't like that I made an extra group for neurodivergent students and told me it would violate HIPAA which is complete BS since it was completely self-selecting and required no medical documentation).

Before the PIP happened, I got put on what was called a ""growth plan"" where I had to send more screenshots of whiteboards to the Tech Mentor and have more office hours. I was doing poorly on my timed submissions of Self Assessments, which was the basis for the whole thing, even after I explained to them that tests aren't where I demonstrate my abilities the best. Before this, they gaslit me with, ""Oh, they're not graded in any way, they're only for you to help yourself"". 

The next chapter of social drama started post Technical Assessment (TA). My result was inconclusive. I technically didn't pass, but my performance was splintered, so they gave me the PIP. I busted my ass over the next few weeks working to complete the PIP requirements on top of the capstone projects we were getting into. My Tech Mentor continued to hate it when I asked for help and the Cohort Lead also reprimanded me for not asking questions that were ""beneficial enough to the group"", again with no advice on how to change this other than to ""think more"". 

One day, my Tech Mentor blew up at me for sending him a Slack message on a Saturday. We were never told this wasn't allowed and it was almost a full day of classes. He told me that I ""should have known, and need to stop doing things at the last minute"" and that he works ""normal"" hours. He then proceeded to take 5 days to actually respond to my inquiry which caused me to miss a PIP deadline. I got an extension, but only under the condition that I not ask the Tech Mentor for any assistance the day before the new due date. I ended up needing some help, but was not allowed to ask for it when I needed it. I also got told that I ""just needed to have an eye for what was being asked for"" and not misinterpret vague and contradictory directions.

During all of this, I joined the Telegraph Track, which is a big smorgasbord for all kinds of marginalized groups and asked the person running it for resources and advice related to being neurodivergent and in a bootcamp. This person was generally rather unresponsive and only sent really generic stuff like Web MD pages with symptom checklists for autism and ADHD, while also later deleting some of what I wrote in the general Slack channel for that specific workspace without explaining why. It was here that I was able to get in touch with other students and find out about their stories.

I also went back to the Accommodations Team to try and beef up my accommodations. Like before, they gave me the 50% extended testing time without any issue, but everything else was a struggle and half-assed. They demanded more documentation after I had already submitted a nearly 20-page neuropsychological report.

I found out that a Deaf student had to drop due to an interpreter and closed-captioning not being provided and so much of the curriculum being spoken. I also found out about other neurodivergent students having to switch to part-time or retake the first half (for another half tuition) en masse, as well as cohort staff providing official accommodations rather begrudgingly. 

On my final day, I was called into an office hour with my Tech Mentor and told that I ""shouldn't need someone over my shoulder this much"" and that I seem to learn better when I get more office hours and ""need to learn to apply that to the rest of the program"". I was then told that he ""had some thoughts"" and was off to speak to the Cohort and Program Leads about how to best address the situation and would get back to me by the end of that day. 

Not even 10 minutes later, I got pulled into a meeting with my Tech Mentor and Cohort Lead and told that they ""needed to initiate a separation from the program"" after several minutes of euphemistic and passive-aggressive discussion about ""how I felt about my progress"", reminders to ""see failure as an opportunity for growth"", sprinkled with blame over ""signing the PIP knowing the risks"". I had an impending sense that there was a bandaid they were stalling ripping off.

They left me with no recommendations besides really generic stuff like Udacity and immediately revoked my access to all of the portals and materials and I was told that I was being ""sent to the separations team for separation processing"". I was a few weeks shy of being assigned a Telegraph Mentor as well.

That day, I emailed the Program Lead explaining what happened to me and asked to either have a full refund, be reinstated, or moved to a part-time cohort at no additional cost, as well as asking who to talk to if it were someone higher up. This message was completely ignored. I also filled out a formal complaint form. The last I've heard is that it ""will be investigated in the next 14 business days"". This same person I sent the complaint form to quickly sent a 1/3 refund back where it came from with a receipt. My psychologist wanted to add his two cents to the complaint evidence submitted but was told that it was not allowed for him to talk to anybody there about me.

The family friend who initially recommended the program glowingly is getting in touch with his own connections to let them know how it went for me and saying he will never recommend this program ever again to anybody.

**The End**

There it is folks. I wanted to put this out there because when I was looking at reviews on different bootcamps, I couldn't find any regarding students coming in with a situation like mine and think it will help others make an informed decision. I also think it is good for people to know where these places stand in 2022 after being acquired since some have alluded to things ""not being the same"" after that happened."

codingbootcamp,Got my first job two weeks after bootcamp!,1663793150,"Recently completed a backend bootcamp offered through Promineo Tech / Elgin Community College.

I was pretty well self-taught beforehand, so I knew most of the concepts already, but it was absolutely beneficial to learn in a structured environment with other people.  There were a lot of things I knew, but couldn't have explained in an interview until after discussing it with classmates and our mentors.  

I started applying for positions about 6 weeks before the bootcamp ended, and got a lot of rejection emails. A lot, a lot.

But, finally, during the last week of bootcamp and as I'm wrapping up my final project, I receive an invitation to schedule an interview.  Awesome! It's a national insurance company but they have a local branch here in Chicago.

Over the next two weeks, I go through a few rounds of interviews and solve a bunch of Java and SQL challenges.  Last Thursday evening, I get the offer, which I sign and return on Friday.  I was set to start October 3.

Then, Monday happens.  I get another phone call.  I'm not sure of all the details, but the *old* manager thought there was room for me in the budget and the *new* manager disagrees.

So yeah.  I knew it was going to be hard to secure my first job but never expected I'd have it yanked away from me so quickly after getting it. 🙃

codingbootcamp,Is a coding bootcamp a good fit for someone without a college/bachelor degree ?,1663598653,"I’m looking to switch careers from my current job , to the tech field .

I went to a community college in NY but for financial reasons I had to drop out, so I don’t have a degree other than a high school diploma that I earned it  in my country (Ecuador). I started to learn about computer programming since I was in high school but never really dig deep into it . But for the past 3 months I wanted to quit driving and start a new career so I started learning on my own ( Udemy courses , YouTube , Google , Codeacademy ), and really enjoy learning new stuff and how the softwares  or websites I use in daily basis are created using those technologies. So my question is what are my chances of getting a job in the field without prior experience nor college/bachelor degree at all ? I’m planning to go to a coding Bootcamp, I have as my main option Codesmith , second Hackreactor and the last one is one local bootcamp in my area called Launch Academy. I applied to codesmith and already did their coding challenge which was very easy. I don’t know if this helps in programming but I’m really good at math but terrible at writing lol.

I would say I fit the character for coding, problem solver, high attention to detail, enjoy working with computers. I've previously left a successful career which I wasn't finding forfilling and in search of something new. Im 34, education is degree level. I'm not chasing the salary that's thrown around with coding, but the flexibility of remote working is so appealing.

Rather than self learning and then applying for junior coder role I have been looking for ""no experiance"" apprenticeship roles as I know that's my preference for learning, but have found them extremely limited (made worse by living in a rural area).

The only apprenticeship role I have found is created by Makers that offered free enrolement into their next cohort (if I qualified) and employment with ""someone"". I signed up and have 10 days to complete learning Ruby course on codeacademy then an exam. Makers have described Ruby as one of the easiest to learn first?

I'm 5/6 hours in (over 2 days /25% complete) and feel I'm struggling already to comprehend/remember some of the processes. I don't want to give up, I'm more frustrated that exhausted that I can't actively speak to a teacher.

Are my struggles ""normal"" and have others struggled when they first got into coding? 

Im presuming going straight into any bootcamp right now will largly be a waste of my money.

I've been an actor in LA for years and had a fair amount of success. However, at this point in life I'm not where I'd hoped I'd be. Along the way to support my acting, I worked many jobs including, background actor, personal trainer, bartender and small business owner. I am currently working as a bartender and still running my small business, but when covid came, both those were heavily impacted along with TV and film production being shut down. All that to say, all my endeavors for the most part were failing me.

I have a Bachelor's but never put it to use professionally. With the time I was laid off and not auditioning or booking work, I took the time to do the Google Data Analytics Specialization through Coursera and completed it in 38 weeks. No luck finding any work doing that, but I did enjoy the R Programming part of the course which ultimately brought me to coding.

A friend of a friend got into Codesmith and ended up getting a position with Disney, so I was highly motivated and started looking at bootcamps, namely Codesmith. I enjoy learning already and discovered that I REALLY enjoyed learning coding over these last 3 months, and committed myself to making that my career path.

I am seeing from everywhere that Codesmith makes it really hard to get into their program. I've already done 2 of their courses, JavaScript for Beginners and CS Prep, and I am still feeling unprepared and terrified out of my mind of taking their TA. I feel like I've learned so much, but still know so little. 

Today I took the TAA for Hack Reactor and got 3 or 4 in and I didn't panic, but kept trying to figure it out but ultimately had to ask to move on to the next one because maybe I didn't fully understand the prompt or was just confused. Ultimately I don't think I succeeded. I took the TAA with Hack Reactor because I decided to open up the possibilities for me to get into a good bootcamp outside of Codesmith, because I dont think I could ever get in. Especially after todays disaster. I also applied to Fullstack Academy and got in with just doing a written assessment test online and no TA required. Should I be concerned with the quality of Fullstack since they did not require a TA like Codesmith and Hack Reactor? Truth be told, I may end up at Fullstack because I'm not the best test taker, but I feel like I've learned so much over the last 3 months then I get a proctored Zoom test and go blank. 
I'm kind of just venting now, sorry, but this is really the career path I want and I am trying everything to make it happen, but I desire the structure of a bootcamp. I want to be a frontend developer, and am enrolled in Meta's frontend specialization through coursera, and also purchased Colt Steels Udemy course, so I'm in it. I guess I'm just at a low moment right now. Any advice on anything I've said? Any Fullstack grads out there? How was the part-time course? Was it challenging to get a well-paying job in the end? Thank you all in advance for letting me vent like aitrlw b%$*!"

I had been bouncing around different career paths for several years in my 20s.

Ultimately I quit my full time logistics position last year to enter Nursing as I really enjoyed the medical field and spent about a year being an EMT to prepare for that, however, Covid really killed my drive and seeing people pass away on a week to week basis destroyed most of my conviction. 

Finally around January 2022 I decided to enter full time into software engineering and was accepted into CodeSmith around April of this year. I finished the program in July and immediately began applying the moment I graduated, after about two and a half months of hardcore applications and studying, I received an offer. Some people have asked me how I'm feeling, and honestly it's probably relief, I was running on fumes emotionally and just finally receiving an offer that I actually liked was incredibly relieving...

Some Stats:

- Applications Submitted: 151
- Easy Applies: 39
- Hired Inbounds: 3
- Total Apps/Hired: 193
- Inbounds (Phone Screenings): 15
- Offers: 1

Next Steps:

I signed my offer this past week, so I'm awaiting to finish background checks and references, but I see no issue with that, like I said in the title I do not have a Bachelor's and saw yes there were some opportunities that I did not receive because of that, but I had about a 13% inbound rate which seems to be an average amount from what I was reading. I start in Oct so I will most likely be trying to finish my degree online while I work. 

Ultimately, I hope I'm not being show offey with this AMA but rather I just wanted to give back to this subreddit as the numerous other AMAs about CodeSmith and bootcamps were so helpful in me choosing this route. 

**All that to say please AMA and apologies for the wall of text!"
codingbootcamp,"Is going to college for coding worth it or does ""bootcamp"" work just as well?",1663260164,"For about 6 months now, I've been thinking about going with Python programming as a career choice, but I haven't taken any steps because I just don't know where to start. I started the Harvard course that teaches you the basics of coding and it definitely seemed like something I would enjoy.

Would you go college to learn Python, or do you think a ""bootcamp"" would work just as well? If so, what are some good reputable programs I can enroll in that are remote and help you with job placement after? 

Feel free to share your pros and cons with difference places or your experience as I'd like to weigh out my options. Sharing your experience with getting into coding as a careering choice, as a whole, is also helpful! Thanks in advance! (If it matters, I'm located in central Florida)."
codingbootcamp,Evolution of a developer,1663259329,"The evolution of a developer can be divided into four main stages: novice, intermediate, expert, and master.

Novice developers typically have little to no experience in coding and software development. They often start out by following tutorials and learning the basics of programming. As they gain more experience, they begin to understand how to code more efficiently and how to solve problems more effectively.

codingbootcamp,Update on me waiting for a call from the codesmith folks: They asked me to schedule a second interview,1663088367,"I got the below wall of text as  feedback.  


I got into all the bootcamps i applied to other than this. I think they have a higher bar I guess or are looking for something specific.  


The last question that left me dumbfounded was they wanted me to count the length of an array without using any native js method or loops.  


So my go to thought was recursion but to reduce the input, i would have needed some method. so that's where I got stuck.  


Do people usually get into them in their first interview?  


    Thank you for taking some time to chat with our team. I wanted to follow up with the specific feedback that was discussed from your technical interview.
    
    Areas of Strength:
    - Analytical Skill - Amazing job parsing through the prompt and expected output to fully understand the question. You did a great job at grabbing the important information out of the prompt and using it in your solution.
    
    -JS Fundamentals - You demonstrated a really solid understanding of a number of native JS functions and fundamentals, whether you were tackling array methods or complicated callback implementations.
    
    Areas for improvement:
    -Technical Communication - While you effectively communicated your approach, there were a number of times, especially upon hitting errors, that you became very quiet, so I couldn't tell where you were stuck. Practicing pair programming a little more will help you with that!
    
    - Pseudo code is an important tool, try using it a little more in your solutions. It can be useful in a number of ways. It will help you practice your technical communication as you write out and explain the steps and strategies to solve the challenge. Another strength of pseudo code is that it can help you stay on track when you are trying to solve more complex algorithms.
    
    - Debug strategy - While you managed to debug the majority of your problems I'd highly recommend learning some tried and tested debug strategies to help you track down issues faster. This will only serve you later in your engineering career.
    
    Take 3 weeks to continue preparing and then schedule your second technical interview to take place anytime on or after 10/3. Please be aware of the technical interview deadline for your desired cohort."

codingbootcamp,Reskill Americans Fall 2022 Cohort,1662826444,"I've been looking into this one for a little over a year now and you can really only find reviews or experiences with it here and there. They've finally opened enrollment for their next cohort that starts on October 3rd.  It's a free 7 month online bootcamp but the only catch is it's for racial minorities only.  I wasn't sure how they'd be able to verify that given that it says 'self-identify' but it does require you to have a LinkedIn account with a profile picture to enroll so I guess that's something although I still don't see how that prevents people from lying.  What really made me want to try it out was it being free (obviously) but also that there doesn't appear to be a set schedule where you have to meet at certain times on certain days for several hours as that just doesn't work for me or a lot of people who either work full time or just have other obligations that don't make that possible.  They do also have a LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube channel which seem to get posted to somewhat regularly.  The most I've found for reviews or experiences is on their LinkedIn which is still somewhat scarce.  It definitely seems worth a try if you qualify and don't want to spend thousands on some other bootcamp. If it doesn't work out or you don't graduate, at least you managed to get some experience at no financial loss or burden.   


TLDR: Reskill Americans is a free 7 month online bootcamp for minorities with the next cohort starting on October 3rd.

I then started conversing with real developers at my work who told me to stop spending so much time researching and to just DO IT. $179 later, I found myself using Udemy chipping away at the material.

I created the simple Google doc below to hold myself accountable. I divided the 579 units proportionally over 12 weeks (my initial goal) and then went to town making serious progress at the beginning. But as you can see from the chart, I experienced two prolonged slumped period where I made little to no progress. I felt like giving up a few times but I continued.

At the end of it all, it took me 20 weeks to finish the entire course. I am working a full time job which is why I couldn't finish it any sooner, but I'm still proud of myself.

To all those in this subreddit spending countless hours researching, just stop. Buy a top rated course on Udemy or some other platform and start.

Hello , Today in this blog you’ll learn how to create Drag &amp; Drop List using HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript. 

**Drag and drop** is a marking device gesture in which the user selects a virtual thing by “grabbing” it and dragging it to a separate area or onto another virtual thing. **Sortable JS** is a Javascript library that lets you sort or reorder lists by dragging and dropping list items.

In this program \[Drag &amp; Drop List or Draggable List\], there are five lists or cards on the webpage and these are draggable items or lists. Users can easily reorder the items in an underorder list, giving users a visual dimension to particular actions and modifications.

to make an item draggable I used the JavaScript SortableJS library, so there are no vast codes for JavaScript.

codingbootcamp,Python vs JavaScript bootcamps,1662723221,"Why do the majority of bootcamps focus on JavaScript? If anyone has attended bootcamps more focused on Python, can you please tell more about your experience. Were you able to land a job? Is it better to learn JavaScript first or Python?"

codingbootcamp,Code Fellows - Anyone?,1662671316,"Hello! Looking into code fellows boot camp. Has anyone attended this camp before? 

If so, how long did it take for them to respond to your application? I applied a week ago and have heard nothing back. If you landed a Job after the bootcamp, how well did your teachings from the bootcamp transfer over to your SDE position!? I'm hoping to hear something back from them. Every other bootcamp i'v looked into got back with me pretty quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks,"
codingbootcamp,Would it be a bad Idea for me to look for a bootcamp?,1662663628,"Feel free to tell me this is a stupid idea, but I'm a college graduate from 2021 in CIS, but I've been struggling to find a job and I think one of the biggest reasons is because my skills and projects are so weak. I've been doing my best to build them up but I still haven't been able to land a position. 

I've been debating on going to a bootcamp for a little while, but I have been told in the past that it's not a good idea since I've already gotten a degree. However, I have recently met with someone during a small program who's coding skills were a lot better than mine, and they've gone to a bootcamp and didn't get their degree.

So my question is, are there any other CIS college graduates who went to a bootcamp after graduation? Did you feel as if it was worth it? And if there are really good ones for Front-End (Including React, Angular, ETC) which ones did you go to? 

Thanks for your help."

codingbootcamp,"Want to get into software, but worried about my background..",1662605987,"So I have been researching boot camps a lot as I am dying to make a career change. What I am worried about is landing a job with my criminal background. I got a DUI a couple of years ago and that is on my record as well as giving false information to a police officer all because I told him I was not driving. I know I messed up and made that mistake, but I’m just curious if anybody has experience or knowledge on how deeply companies will care about your criminal record? I really don’t want to spend upwards of $15,000+ to go through a coding Boot Camp and not be able to get a job anywhere because of my record. Any help is much appreciated, thank you."
codingbootcamp,Is Springboard desperate?,1662599080,"I applied for Springboard because I hear Colt Steeles name thrown around in reddit all the time so figured it would be a decent place to get a coding job. I submitted the application that just had a bunch of questions about my background and what I want to get into. A little bit later I got a response saying that they would want to call me for an interview and to take a technical assessment. I didn't pick up the call because I wasnt fully sure about the bootcamp. Nonetheless I tried out the technical assessment and answered 2/4 questions and stopped because I just got lazy and again I wasnt very onboard with the program despite applying. So I closed down my browser and let the time run out. Hours later I get an email and text saying ""Congratulations on your acceptance on the Software Engineering track"". The email was a bit more descriptive saying that I should go to their ""Foundations to Core"" path first which seems to be the basics before the meat of the program so I'm wondering if they just send these acceptance letters to anybody? 

I'm kind of intrigued now so I maybe want to add another discussion as to whether or not Springboard is good? I was about to enroll into Actualize coding bootcamp, but they teach Vue which is not bad per se, but I want to learn technologies that everyone says is more in demand like React.

From what I read around the subreddit, I heard the program is self paced and solo work where you learn through their lessons with no one else (no classmates) and then you have a mentor to help you along the way. Why does Springboard mention that there are cohorts on certain dates if we're we just learning on our own. If the solo learning is true, I think I'd prefer that more since I have some experience with self teaching coding. I don't want to go into a bootcamp and go through the absolute basics and there are people asking questions that I know the answer to."
codingbootcamp,CodeSmith Grads-How to get best job offers,1662594662,I am doing research on CodeSmith and Hack Reactor and see the data CIRR provides on the graduates and their job placements.  I'm based in LA and would prefer to do an in person setting to try and make the most of the program if I do go.  My question is how do some grads end up in positions making over 150k right away and others are in jobs under 80k?  Are the grads at the high end generally the people who came in with backgrounds in the industry already and have a leg up on their resume?  Is there anyway for someone who is transitioning careers (from a business background) to go to one of these two bootcamps and graduate and realistically expect to see an initial salary over 120k or is that wishful thinking?  What can be done to maximize the experience and ultimately turn it into the highest return on investment?

codingbootcamp,I’m thinking of learning to code. Can I get some enthusiastic inspiration for learning? Where do I begin?,1662576750,"So I’m 28 and I know almost nothing about coding. I have also recently realized I’m autistic and I’ve heard that my particular pattern thinking style mind is good for coding. I’m really into music and understanding music theory using geometry and computation. I 100% want to make an app for musical set theory and I know the features I want; I just figured I’d need to outsource it to someone else, but lately I’m thinking maybe I could learn to make a music theory app myself. 

Is this a feasible goal for me given roughly a 5 year timeframe?

codingbootcamp,Considering bootcamp but worried about taking a paycut,1662575308,"I’m really interested in learning to code and pursing engineering as a career but I’m concerned about some of the salary posts I’ve seen.

For some background I’ve been an engineering recruiter for 7+ years. I’ve worked at FAANG companies + a very well known startup. 

Being an eng recruiter I do feel like I have a ton of insight into salaries + how to be successful during the interview process (which I think could be an advantage for me) Although I’ve admittedly, have hired almost no bootcampers. 

Currently I make 165k + my pre-IPO equity. I’ve seen a lot of posts about people getting out of bootcamp and making 60k. I have recruiting—but not enough to take a 100k paycut.

If anyone has any advice or has a similar background and can share their post bootcamp salary it would help immensely!"

codingbootcamp,Last call for Perpetual Education's September 12th start date,1662564988,"Hello. It's Ivy from PE (you know, that intimate web developer boot camp for people who want to learn to design and build web applications)

I know there are a lot of people around here trying to choose a school, and I'm the one who will have to deal with people that don't find out about us for 2 more weeks and are then sad that there are no sessions again for three more months, so, I'm posting this here. We have a few spots left right now.

There are a bunch of really great schools out there! So, how is PE different? Who is PE for? 

PE might be is good fit for you if you want:

* to learn part-time / (might have a job/obligations)
* to have a daily drip of bite-sized (and fun) lessons
* to make your own daily work schedule - but with accountability each day
* to learn way more than surface-level HTML, CSS, and JS
* to learn enough visual design to connect all the dots and enjoy it
* to enter the field with a lot of real-world experience
* to have an impressive portfolio of work
* to have room to decide what roles to specialize in and custom support
* to learn some UX and UI in a holistic way
* to feel a deep level of confidence with your decision making
* to have access the teacher _all the time_ (who wrote the curriculum)
* to have career guidance and coaching from day one
* to pick up any new hot library or framework quickly because you have a solid foundational knowledge of the reasons those things exist - and you've made them yourself

It's a reverse-engineered learning path that breaks it up into the most fun and digestible pieces possible. 2-4 hours a day. No sitting on zoom calls watching a teacher talk. Instead, you can read/watch the lesson, and the teacher can save that time for much more personal attention.

we also just keep adding tons of new extra resources, and yeah yeah yeah - you can read it on [the website](https://perpetual.education).

https://perpetual.education

You can [book a time to talk to ME (and probably Derek) any time](https://calendly.com/perpetual-education/priority-meeting). I'm a real person. Not a salesperson. So, you'll just get real honest human info about what we offer and if it's a good fit for your learning style. If another school is a better fit, we'll tell you about it! Our primary goal is to get legit developers/designers trained up and out in the world to make better things asap."

codingbootcamp,Boot Camp recommendations,1662534195,"Im looking for a boot camp to enroll into. I don’t have any coding experience at all, I’m new to the whole thing. I don’t mind front end/ back end/ full stack. I desperately would like to land a job in coding asap, what is the best boot camp for landing a job? I dont have a lot of money to spend but I can finance for one if I know it’s worth it but I don’t want to get scammed. If anyone can point me Into the right direction I would appreciate it a lot. I do t know which boot camps are legit and I can’t afford getting scammed. I’m in the Seattle area but will most likely do online camp so nation wide would work. Also if anyone knows about the “learn for free and give them a cut of your pay to pay back the schooling”, I’m curious if that is worth it"

codingbootcamp,My coding journey 2 years after finishing a coding bootcamp,1662518426,"I finished my coding bootcamp in late 2019. I took a bootcamp on C#, .NET, MS SQL and other common stuff like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. It took me 10 months to get my first real job (my 2nd job). After that I would constantly have recruiters reaching out to me for opportunities. The first job is key, it’s very hard to land but if you’re persistent and build apps while looking for a job you’ll be very happy in the end. I’m talking about building real apps. Find a real problem and make an app to solve the problem. Don’t post a todo app on your resume.  

1st job —- My first job was a Jr Software Engineer at $30/hr as a contractor. One month into it I got laid off because of Covid.

After 8 months of applying and building a full stack ASP.NET MVC application with full CRUD functionality and hosting it on Microsoft Azure I was able to catch recruiters attention.

2nd job —— I got a software engineering job at a major distribution center that was remote. I got paid $68k salary. After 7 months I quit and got a new job for higher pay.

3rd job —- I got a job as a software engineer at a major corporation making $105,000 fully remote where I am currently working now. 


I have nothing against college but I have no degree and I used to be a construction worker. Do research on coding bootcamp before you attend it!"

codingbootcamp,Tech Elevator and “Middle Skills” Question,1662491912,"Tech Elevator is opening a school in my State (Delaware). The first classes are set to begin in January of 2023. The classes may be tuition free or discounted through an intermediary organization named Tech Impact. Tech impact is being funded by a Delaware Department of Labor One Workforce grant, with the goal to train current job seekers for middle-skilled occupations in the IT industry.

I'm looking to make a career switch through this boot camp. My salary is roughly $72K per year, depending on my bonus. I'm college educated with a degree in accounting.

My questions are the following -

What are ""middle-skills"" in IT? Will I likely make more money than I am now learning ""middle"" IT skills?I don't want to quit my job to make less money.

I have no prior background or knowledge about coding. What am I setting myself up for by going through Tech Elevator in terms of career?
I don't want to end up working an IT help desk for example. I'm interested in cyber security and software development, but open to other paths as well.

Here are the links I've been looking at. If you have some more helpful resources it would be appreciated. I just fell down this rabbit hole today, and I'm nervous about making a large career change.

codingbootcamp,Week 8 App Academy Update,1662489589,"Hey guys I am halfway through A/A's 16 week in person bootcamp and I want to give a general overview of the course and my experience's, this won't be in much detail, if you have specific comments please drop your questions below or DM me.

1. Test experience : So basically I failed rails 1, and just passed rails 2. So if you fail a test early you aren't totally fucked for the next test. As for other students in the class, two students are currently retaking rails 2 to be able to stay in the class. Your first fail is NP, your second fail requires you to retake it that day and you have to pass to stay in the class. The tests are not impossible, but I dedicated basically the entire previous week to studying for this test. My biggest take away that it is truly impossibly to cram. If any tests require memorization, and a lot do... if you go into the weekend not already having the memorization down your fucked, basically that simple
2. TA experience : Extremely Hit/Miss, unfortunately like most bootcamps  there's 1 real instructor and 2 ""helpers"" who are called ta's but are too inexperienced imo to be called TA's. Basically you ping a question on A/A's app (like a queue), and when its your turn they will come over to help you. Unfortunately the help you get is hit or miss based on who comes over to help you. But in their defense, they are all over worked/under paid, and unlimited questions to attend to after they get to you lol. On some days it can take up to 30min for a TA to come assist you, which by that point you probably figured it out 
3. Is in person worth it : In my opinion 100% yes, it's awesome being able to ask the person sitting next to you if they got up to this point in days project, and I actually feel like I have learned more from teaching/being taught by my fellow peers. The first 2 weeks are remote and dropping into random break out rooms is not the same vibe. Also I have a kid at home... so getting out of the house is amazing. Class goes from 9-6, but you don't have to leave until the cleaning people dip out around 9/10"

Ive applied for the Galvanize scholarship but was wondering if anybody knows any other scholarships for this kind of program that galvanize can take?

Thank you in advance for any advice anyone has for me!"
codingbootcamp,I Feel Like Dropping Out Of Trilogy's Bootcamp...,1662486514,"I'm taking the Trilogy web dev bootcamp and I regretted it. We're almost half way through, we're currently doing the second project which is chaotic because none of my teammates know what to do and we're a group of 6 people and I feel like I have to do the majority of the work because they're all lost. 

I made a post about my experience 3 months into Trilogy's bootcamp in an unbias way if you'd like to read, but at this point that post is pretty inaccurate now with my current experience.. [https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/wtbzn2/my\_experience\_with\_trilogy\_bootcamp\_so\_far\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/wtbzn2/my_experience_with_trilogy_bootcamp_so_far_3/)

For context, the project we're doing requires a ton of backend stuff like SQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM, Authentication, custom-made get, push, delete APIs, and a bunch of other crap. I'm using Traversy Media's Express video as a template but I feel like just taking an L and dropping out and just paying the remaining 2k dollars of the tuition and letting my team mates on their own.

A few weeks ago almost half way through the course, I found out that all of the curriculum and material that we are learning was leaked in 2019 and has barely changed at all, and in some cases, it has been downgraded because the 2019 material was a lot more documented than what we were given in 2022. So I feel like I was completely ripped off because the tuition costs around 12k and so we paid that much money for content that was already leaked years ago and has barely been updated that I could've studied in my own free time instead of going with the class's unrealistically extreme fast pace.

And also, we won't even put in the bootcamp in our resume because that'll affect our hiring chances because employers have a stigma about code camps so everyone will omit that anyways. What interviewers will ask is to see any Github work or projects, but the problem is the class is so chaotic that people barely know what's going on and that leads to one of the member (me in this case) has to do most of the workload for the group. This is unrealistic because the project requires many people to work on it, but we're only given 4 days to work on it in a class of 3 hours total. 

I explained to my TA the situation and so far he hasn't responded for 5 days. Don't know if I said something that may have offended him or something but I'm confident I haven't because it's related to the bootcamp itself and not the TA or instructor's teachings. They're both doing the best they can to teach us but something needs to be done about Trilogy so that they stop ripping people off on free content that they never bothered updating, or at least rewrite their coursework so it's more up to date. 

Can anyone give me their opinion? Good and negative is welcome, I really need to hear any other perspectives about this before I make a decision."
codingbootcamp,Week 3 of the Hack Reactor 19 wk program,1662469921," Holy Moses. I almost forgot to post this week because I have spent so many hours studying. I am truly braindead at this point haha. If you want to know more about my background and this journey I'm taking, please see my previous posts! 

This week we dove even deeper into Django along with some additional HTML and CSS. We're getting closer and closer to the end of our first module. We will have a final project due on the 16th this month and a final assessment on the 19th. The project will be fullstack incorporating what we've learned from Django, Python, CSS and HTML. It's not going to be crazy elaborate, but it's going to definitely be a lot of work. 

This week we had only about a quarter of the lectures we've had the previous two weeks. Mostly worked on projects and had time to ask questions about certain debugging issues, etc. The lectures we did have were really helpful about trimming down our Django models, functions, and templates. 

Many of us in the class are very active together in a discord server so we also worked together on some of the projects and studied together all through the long weekend. I studied an average of about 8 hours a day over Labor Day weekend. You don't have to study that much, but I just had so much that I wanted to practice and work through again to solidify what I've learned.

I'm still really enjoying myself and loving the program. I'm just really tired haha. 

Sorry to be really short this week. I'll do my best to answer questions, but I may not get to some this week. 3 weeks down, 16 to go! &lt;3"
codingbootcamp,Starting bootcamp soon. Feeling scared.,1662443674,"Hey everyone,

Some background about myself. Worked 5 years in digital marketing, currently a marketing project manager at a gaming company working on product launches. 

A couple months ago multiple events at work triggered me to think about my career and what I want to do for the rest of my life. I made the decision to look into programming/software engineering, something I’ve always had an interest in. I took some web dev/python classes on udemy and felt comfortable as well. I plan on attending General Assembly’s SEI 12 week bootcamp in a couple months, which I’m really excited for, however also scared at the same time.

I guess I am more so scared that I’ll be quitting my job, wont be working for a few months (maybe even year), scared for the journey ahead. Reading success stories on reddit or youtube definitely help motivate me. I’m writing this post on reddit just to see if there are others out there that have been through similar situations and can share their story. Whether it’s success or failure, I’d love to hear more about it and why you feel it happened. 

I’ve reached out to many people on LinkedIn that graduated from GA’s bootcamp and are currently Software Engineers. Most, if not all of them had zero engineering background which I find impressive. I also got a lot of feedback telling me to do Codewars, Leetcode everyday, and to also start applying to jobs 2 months into bootcamp. So another reason for this post would be to open the discussion up to any advice you guys have to give someone in my position. 

Nonetheless, looking forward to the bootcamp and my future career i suppose. I didn’t try too hard to write this all out, so apologies for the grammatical errors.

Thanks in advance for sharing!"

codingbootcamp,App Academy or Codesmith?,1662418848,"Hi everyone - I've done a ton of research and read/watched a lot of reviews and narrowed down my boot camps to App Academy or Codesmith.   


I was able to pass both interviews and now I have to pick which one to go for. Both have a high number of reviews and a positive average on the surface but once I started reading reviews I saw that App Academy has had a ton of negative reviews pop up recently with people claiming all sorts of things.   


Stuff like ""The program lacks representation of womxn, POC, and other minority groups. Also in my cohort, these marginalized groups left the program at a higher rate.""  


"" The curriculum quality after the first month took a nosedive and the staff was either not knowledgeable and reading off solutions, or they didn't help at all.""  


""Having been to appacademy less than 10% of my original cohort made it. ""  


Are there any recent graduates here that can corroborate any of this?  


In contrast, I struggle to find anything negative about Codesmith, although there are definitely less reviews because I think they're smaller?"

codingbootcamp,"For Codesmith Grads: If you could do it all over again, How would you prepare before attending Codesmith?",1662359491,"There was recently a post like this but directed towards Hack Reactor graduates and I wanted to get some perspective from Codesmith graduates. I will be attending a Codesmith full time immersive in the next 3-4 months and was wondering if you would do anything differently a 2nd time around.      

Are there any difficult topics you wished they covered more on? or maybe topics that were not as in depth as you wanted them to be? Some things I'm already considering are App academy open, TOP, CS50, a UDEMY full stack ""bootcamp"" course.     

If you had a few months of free time before attending Codesmith, what other topics/concepts would you study before the program?"

codingbootcamp,Is HackReactor too difficult with no experience?,1662349710,"I kinda fucked up for the first part of my life so I currently don’t really have an education. I dropped out of highschool as a junior and got my ged and almost got an AS but I dropped out of college when covid happened. I’m unhappy with my situation so I thought maybe this could be a career path for me that I can enjoy since I’ve always loved computers. I have more computer knowledge than the average person and very basic html and css understanding. I was going to do codingdojo but a software engineer friend of mine recommended hackreactor (he didnt go there, he has a cs degree) because be heard good things about it, and conveniently theres an in person campus in my city so I figured it’d be much easier for me to grasp what I’m being taught if I have instructors in person that can help me when I’m struggling. I see that I must take a technical assessment to be accepted in, which I plan on starting to study for after I call them up tomorrow, but I guess I’m a little worried if I’m overshooting here. I don’t want to drop $18k on a bootcamp, then fail and have nothing to show for it. Is it realistic for me to go into it with next to no experience coding and actually complete the course? Any advice from previous graduates would be especially awesome."
codingbootcamp,Flatiron VS Generation USA,1662347171,"So I was kicked out of Flatiron's flex program during the 2nd phase (they have 5). I decided to keep going because I love to code but felt like maybe it just wasn't a good fit for me. I applied to Generation USA's Full Stack Jr. Web Developer program. Aside from being free they give you free access to Codecademy and we also have in class lectures and technical assistants who can help if you don't understand any concepts. 100% I've learned more in my 3 weeks with Generation than I did in 7 months at Flatiron and that is with Generation's focus on behavioral skills and mindset. I'm genuinely shocked at how many basics like the command line and general Codimg foundations were not covered at all in the Flatiron curriculum. I'm also on the hook for 100% of the $16,000 tuition at Flatiron because I was past the 30 week mark when they kicked me out. Also on my phase 2 project assessment I actually knew the code challenge. I just ran out of time. I'm thoroughly enjoying my time with Generation USA so far. They do not have you code everyday so I supplement with freeCodeCamp with is amazing and teaches more than the Flatiron curriculum as well. I've been pretty vocal about my lackluster Flatiron experience on LinkedIn. A few people have reached out saying they do not feel supported in their program and wish they had of never signed up. I just wanted to share my experience and I'll update as I go along in the program. I hope this post helps someone. I'll answer any questions I can on the post or through DM."

I think I've done a little too much research at this point and feel like I keep hearing a lot negativity towards bootcamps and the job prospects they offer, or lack there of.

codingbootcamp,Should you rent or own a laptop during and after a bootcamp up until you land a job in hopes they provide a laptop for IT/security purposes?,1662179748,"Hi, I'm looking into a bootcamp that will have ruby on rails in its tech stack. I've read that it's nicer to use macOS for the technologies we will learn and the bootcamp also recommends to learn on a macOS. That being said, I don't own a apple computer. I was thinking of buying a new MacBook just to own one but I figured in the grand scheme of things, I can rent one during my time in the bootcamp and the time it would take to land a job and then eventually hope that a company provides their own equipment. 

If it is a remote company sending equipment, that'll be the best case scenario as I'll have something to still learn from at home, if it's a in person company, I'm assuming there isn't equipment that you can just take home so that would possibly mean I can't study at home?

I do LeetCode problems but I'm sure if I'm asked to explain my thought process to people, I'd be HORRIBLE at it. Like, I passed HackReactor TAA in first attempt, but I saw how poor I was to talk and explain my code to the camera. AWFUL.

codingbootcamp,Choosing a school (Perpetual Education's DFTW),1661874335,"Hi all! I am enrolling in the September cohort of Perpetual Education’s Design for The Web program. 

Please see below for an introduction and some context on why I chose DFTW at the EOD. Hopefully, this can help provide some helpful information for anyone with a similar background/goals. 

**Who**:

Late 30s father of 2 &lt;10 with \~15 years managing a mix of:

* website CMSs (selection, implementation, training and ongoing maintenance)
* paid search 
* paid/organic social media
* landing page design
* analytics (maintenance and ongoing reporting) 
* SEO 
* Local SEO (optimizing offsite directories, yada yada)
* with the above channels, leads-focused campaigns that measure engagement and improve over time against central goals 

… on behalf of clients at agencies or in-house as a digital strategist. 

**Why**:

In my experience, roles in digital marketing / digital strategy have become primarily focused on placed on platforms that aren’t owned (social channels, directory/ranking sites). For someone who loves creating a unique digital product to represent a client, web development offers a “blank slate” to build and design with. I am growing tired of managing paid campaigns and focusing more on off-site properties that don’t foster much creativity (i.e., choosing different ways to use user’s data on FB to benefit a client). 

I want to gain a very deep and holistic understanding of how everything connects in web development… here’s why: 

* This is mostly fueled by a lifetime love of technology (first discovered on a Macintosh SE in the early 90s). 
* *Also:* working in digital marketing has allowed me to stay up-to-date in web design and development, and that has strengthened my interest in the field. 

My current interests align with the responsibilities of front-end designers/developers, but I acknowledge that the curriculum covers the full stack. Who knows, maybe I’ll fall in love with something further back in the …stack? 

**How**: 

I started the **Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN** in 2021 and was horrified by how poorly it was executed. Within the first 2 weeks, it was clear the program was a less organized method of quickly entering tutorial hell without support. If you’re interested in this program, PLEASE do a search and look at the critical reviews. They might have made some improvements, but it looks like some recent cohorts are reporting similar experiences. 

After researching coding bootcamps/front-end design programs for years at that point, I honestly didn’t think there was one that wasn’t solely focused on bringing in tuition dollars. That changed after I stumbled into a few posts that mentioned Perpetual Education’s Design for The Web mentorship. I binged on a few videos from the website and their YT channel, and quickly found that their approach aligns perfectly with my background (from the “who” section above) and goals (from the “why” section above). 

After a recent conversation with Derek, I found myself more excited to gain a broad understanding of the web dev field, while focusing on an area that I love dearly in design. With PE’s mentorship and community of other learners that are similarly focused on building beautifully representative digital experiences for clients, I’ll be WAY better off with their curricular delivery as a full-timer (1 core concept a day, 6x a week, along with real-life client work and building a portfolio/).

**What next?**: 

I’ll keep ya posted here! Very excited for to join this September cohort, and wanted to share The who/why/how. 

I’ll get back to you on the what and where. :)"

codingbootcamp,Help choosing bootcamp - Hackbright Academy vs. Prime Digital Academy,1661743878,"Hi guys, I have been accepted into two different bootcamps. I am in Minneapolis, MN for reference and have a bachelors in biochemistry. I've been accepted into Prime Digital Academy, a 20 week full-time bootcamp that is in person, and Hackbright Academy, a 12 week full-time bootcamp that is online. I qualified for full tuition scholarships for both so I thankfully will not have to pay anything no matter my choice. I'm really grateful for this!! Both bootcamps will be starting in September.

For reference, I've been using The Odin Project for the last 7 months so I would say I have pretty decent skills in HTML, CSS, and Java/JavaScript. Prime is a longer course, so I think I'll be able to learn a lot more new material. What makes me question this is I don't want to waste time when I could already be working since Hackbright is a shorter program. Hackbright is teaming up with Target for my cohort, so I'll have the opportunity to interview with Target before the course is over if I work hard enough. The problem with this is I don't know if 12 weeks is enough to learn new stuff, they're going to spend the first couple weeks going over stuff I already know how to do.

codingbootcamp,COURSE REPORT?,1661717898,"I recently came across this site.  [https://www.coursereport.com/](https://www.coursereport.com/)  


they have a lot of reviews from different boot camps as well as schools and universities, but my question is how trustful are they?  


has anyone visited this site before and trusted the reviews?   


I ask this because I found a place I may look into getting my coding path started, but I don't see much negativity I mostly see 5-star reviews. I don't want to believe they are all good I'm sure some aren't as good as others.   


Just wanted your opinion if you have seen this before."
codingbootcamp,Week 2 of the Hack Reactor 19 wk program,1661707974,"If you want to know more about my background and this journey I'm taking, please see my previous posts!   
Well this was a crazy busy week. We are breaking for a moment from Python and covered HTML, CSS, and Django. To say that my brain is overloaded would be an understatement haha.  


I was mostly afraid of Django in this course, but the projects they have us doing as practice have been incredibly helpful and I really feel very comfortable with Django. HTML was a breeze, as expected. CSS was a little more challenging than I expect and I am doing more self study to sharpen my skills.

What is absolutely incredible is that at this point our class is able to build (very very very simple) full stack projects. I really never thought I'd be able to learn so much so quickly and actually be able to apply it. My partner is a traditional Computer Science grad who is a full stack engineer currently and he said that we are operating at at least yr 2 levels when comparing to his college experience.   


My biggest complaint last week was a lack of hands on project time. We did get more of that this week, but the lectures were still very long. If you do take this program expect to be strapped in for very long lectures the first couple of weeks. When I look ahead at the schedule there are far few long lectures later on, but my gosh for now it hurts my brain. The biggest tip I have for surviving the long lectures is to (even if you don't have a stand/sit desk) to get up and move every once in a while to refocus and not fall asleep. We had a few people doze off this week haha.   


My biggest compliment this week is that the practice projects we were assigned for all the new things we've learned have been crazy helpful in solidifying my personal knowledge of what has been taught. My biggest complaint is once again so much lecturing compared to hands on programming during class time. I spend a couple of hours a day outside of class getting homework done and practicing with projects.   


Feel free to ask any questions! I'll do my best to answer them between homework and class! 2 weeks down, 17 to go! &lt;3"

I have completed half of theodinproject.com and so far is very interesting and enjoying, so I really want to get into this field, but I just don't want to dump a ton of money into a bootcamp if the turn over rate is too high.

codingbootcamp,Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone joined Interview Kickstart technical interview prep bootcamp? How was your experience? was it worth it for learning DSA?Got offer in FAANG? please share your experiences below. I am thinking to join soon. I just want to get people's opinions about that school.,1661652985,
codingbootcamp,Which school can be the most help for a specific app that I'm trying to build,1661651833,"&amp;#x200B;

I’m building an app and I need to learn how to code. In doing this sort of research I realized that not every class/curriculum would necessarily teach the skills that I need for this particular project. So in digging in I thought I would reach out and see if I lay out the parameters of the app and what I expect it to do, someone could point me in the right direction. That way I won't be wasting my time say on learning web development when the whole time I should have been knee deep in computer science. 

*Along the way I’m looking for a technical co founder but I understand that I need to be learning along the way in the expectation that I won’t be able to find one with little to no funding and I’ll need to bootstrap and do it myself.*   
I understand that this won't be easy and I’m not looking for shortcuts, just guidance around which coding bootcamp to join, which free courses to take (Youtube, etc) , and basically to maximize every second of my time. My plan is to eventually run into like minded people along the way, but I’m determined and dedicated to making this happen myself if that ever becomes a reality.

*The type of app I’m building* 

The app I’m building allows you to earn money when you play pickup sports like basketball, football, and soccer.   
The app awards you ½ credit per made shot…250 credits =$5.00. You can also take credits from other users by playing the 1v1 winner takes all. So If I had 245 credits I could go on the app and view a map (picture Uber) find another user and put 5 credits up in a game to 15. The winner would take the credits. If I win I have 250 credits, if I lose I'm back to 240. 

In total there are **7 different ways** to earn including the most monetizable feature of the app spectator mode

**Spectator Mode** 

Spectator mode allows anyone watching to take over a game and completely change how we view pickup sports. The main feature is a live action version on your phone of the game that’s taking place. Track players in real time while they playing keeping track of their **Steals, Points, Block shots, &amp; Turnovers**

Spectator mode is the game mode that rewards the most credits based on accuracy and solves the cheating problem of users inputting their own made up data at the end of matches. Spectator Mode also generates the most revenue as users will spend the most time on spectator mode keeping track of their friends, going live on various social media sites, and maximizing the average time that’s spent on the app (Average pickup games of basketball 17 minutes)

[https://imgur.com/a/nbpOduC](https://imgur.com/a/nbpOduC) &lt;&lt; Spectator Mode

**Quickplay**

Quickplay is the main function of the app and allows you to earn simply by playing basketball as normal.   
Before you start a game you simply select Basketball &gt;&gt; Quickplay &gt;&gt; 5on5 &amp; that’s it.

After the game you record the final score and enter how many shots you made. 1 shot = ½ credit

**Challenge Mode**

Challenge Mode let’s you take the credits that you earned in other game modes and put them up 1v1 against other users. Simply find a user on the app and put up an amount, meet and hoop, winner takes all. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4WVdbIWAJLHCzLP68hBq2nyjlwy-ObU/view?usp=sharing

**The Playbook**

The playbook lets you earn credits completing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks akin to mobile games and typical RPG’s that reward you based on accomplishments and consistency.

**Profile** 

The profile screen is where you’ll find your player rating. Everyone in the app will have a rating just like popular sports video games. You’ll be able to find a player and rate how good he is simply based on his rating

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7L9W6RkMIg4gZvRSzs\_RHH36d5uWKs9/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7L9W6RkMIg4gZvRSzs_RHH36d5uWKs9/view?usp=sharing) &lt;&lt; Player rating

There is a lot more to it but I don’t want to bore you with all of the details but those are just some of the main highlights that will go into creating this. 

**What I have so far**

I’m having sticker shock and worried that I’ve fallen for a scam. I’ve passed the 4 week try out period but haven’t committed to paying anything. Should I cut and run or wait it out until they present the terms of repayment? I don’t feel comfortable taking a loan and paying nearly $6000 for what is essentially a professional development program plus a coursera certificate."

But I want out in the worst way. I’m trying to get into coding. (I am, at the end of the day, an introvert and I’ve been doing basically this since 2012).

codingbootcamp,Looking for people to pair program with on a project,1661554212,"Building out a pair programming platform to help bootcamp students better prepare for technical interviews. You collaboratively solve programming challenges with another peer, helping you get better at communicating your solution while you are problem solving. A skill I am finding to be very important in interviews.  


**How the platform works**

Users sign up to create a profile, start a pair programming session, get matched with a random peer, get access to a code editor, receive a programming challenge and start coding together over an audio call. Users will be able to peer program for free 3-5 times before being required to pay a monthly sub ($10-$15)

**Vision**

The vision is to become a platform focused on helping bootcamp students and self learners both learn and develop interview skills through peer to peer learning. This will go beyond pair programming to live group discussions focused on algorithms and data structures, all primarily focused on peers helping each other learn, become better collaborators and communicators.

**What has been done**

I have been building this out solo for the most part and almost done with the MVP.  What is left is building out the functionality to match users and redirect them to their respective sessions (I have conceptualized how this will work and have most of the code written out).

**Tech Stack**  
Backend: Django  
Cache: Redis  
Frontend: React  
Other: Docker  


Would love to pair program on this project if anyone's keen. Ultimately I am looking for people who will join me long term in this project. I fully intend to turn this into a side-hustle and potential startup depending on how things go.

  
Let me know if you are keen and we can start with a few pair sessions, see how well we work together and take it from there."

Basically, I’m training to become a full stack developer. The training has been nuts. 2.5 months, nonstop lectures and projects. I did pretty good in the beginning, but my problem is teams. 

Most people in my cohort have been coding for years. They’re knowledgable and efficient. I am a beginner and take days to defeat even one error. I don’t learn well in teams. I don’t want to ask questions and risk looking like a loser, since my teammates never ask questions unless they’re high level. I just… want to be myself, to be as bad and slow as I am without the pressure to perform. This gets worse, as interviews are later this week and soon I’ll be working with a company full of “elites”. 

I’m starting to hate coding. I can’t focus or problem solve or anything. I don’t know how to use the frameworks because I’ve never practiced. It’s just learn it through lectures and get thrown directly into development. No familiarization, no playing around, no testing. Just blah. 

I made the start of a solo project so I can give myself the opportunity to learn. But in the end, I don’t even want to do that anymore. 

Did anyone else have a spectacularly difficult time starting out? I feel like in five years I’ll look back and think, remember how unskilled and miserable I was? I just want to confirm. 

Before you say drop it, I don’t really want to. What else am I going to do? Besides, if I quit I owe the company 36k.

codingbootcamp,Week 1 of the Hack Reactor 19 wk program,1661132200,"Here's my first update! You can see my previous post about what I'm doing here.  


I loved my first week in this program. I'm shocked with how much I've learned in just 5 days. We started with exclusively Python. There is a LOT of homework after class is finished. I'm in the Central Time class so we go from 9 am - 6 pm CST. But you spend at least an extra hour or two every night to do the homework, practice problems and work with the class mentors. I don't mind though as I've set aside the time to commit full time to this program.  


I do wish there was a little more hands on programming time in this first week, but I've look ahead at the schedule and the next few weeks are much less lecture heavy. The first week was like almost 5 hours of lecture a day. But that makes sense since most of use have never touched anything to do with coding before. Like I've mentioned, I only knew a tiny bit of SQL before this class so it's definitely overwhelming. But it's not impossible.   


I can see why this is such a highly recommended program. I really feel like I learned so much more in a week than I ever could have on my own. I do wish I had done a little more preparation for the class by doing some python tutorials or something, but live and learn I guess haha.   


Feel free to ask questions, but just remember I've only just finished week 1 with 18 weeks to go!"

codingbootcamp,This subreddit isn't a good place to see what people generally make as a first salary in different cities.,1661110748,"New post because I'm not going to put the same thing as a response to every thread created by the same person over the last hour or so.

* Outcomes are going to be different across time and space.  People who graduated from a bootcamp in May 2020 are going to have markedly different success stories compared to June 2021 graduates.
* Outcomes vary one person to the next.  It doesn't help to see that people in a certain city generally made high salaries without normalizing for things like prior experience, education level, and how good at coding they are.
* This subreddit will have significant survivorship bias.  Bootcamp grads who hang out here will heavily skew in the direction of ones who have found significant career success.
* Not all bootcamps are equal and the truth is that many are scams.  Your choice of Fullstack Academy vs Crazy Carl's Coding 'Cademy matters a lot more than New York vs San Francisco.
* The original thread wasn't at all scientific, but it did have a decent number of respondents.  Fragmenting the same poll into multiple cities should guarantee it doesn't even have that.
* In addition to that last point, there's not even any remarkable trend in the higher *n* original thread.  Some people made a lot, some people made a little."

I do not want to own a car so when reffering to San Francisco I mean the San Francisco proper area where there is good transportation not the south bay silicon valley region. I am mentioning these 2 because they are the top two tech hubs. It appears from everything ive read that the starting salary is about 90-125K in San Francisco and the range for NYC is about 80-110K. It also appears that if I rent a room in New Jersey and commute to NYC or rent a room in NYC that the rent is going to be about $500 less than the rent rent in San Francisco. Which city would you choose to max savings?"

codingbootcamp,Can I be hired at a good company by just grinding DSA?,1661100060,"Im 20 and dropped out of college recently. I know people at FAANG companies so I can get referrals. I was wondering if I just applied with the referrals, would I get an interview? My resume is pretty much empty besides some mediocre personal projects (some random react websites that only I use).  I was in Google CSSI a couple of years ago, if that counts for anything.

My thought process is that if I can get an interview with a referral and my lackluster resume, then should I not just stop everything else and just spend the next month grinding leetcode, and then start applying?

I wanted to go to Codesmith, but then realized it wont really add much to my resume. It will probably make be a much better web developer but would that matter in job interviews?

Please let me know what you think about my thought process."

codingbootcamp,rithm or codesmith,1661090886,"Hi all,

I am switching careers to software engineering, and plan on attending a bootcamp to speed the transition. I am looking into codesmith and rithm and wanted feedback on my overall impressions.

* Rithm appears more lecture based. Their lectures feel more organized and they emphasize small classes / instructor experience.

* Codesmith appears more project based, and learning is expected to take place outside of lecture.

* Rithm emphasizes realistic work scenarios (working through tickets on numbersapi.com) while Codesmith emphasizes projects that are optimized for a CV (creating an open source library)

* Codesmith's community feels more active that Rithm's community.

* Neither bootcamp has connections to existing tech companies for job placement

* Codesmith has a policy for lifetime post-graduation support (resume review, mock interviews). Does anybody have feedback on how realistic this is?

Overall, my feeling is that Codesmith and Rithm are quite similar but Codesmith emphasizes the non-coding aspect of software engineering more (peer programming, your personal story, CV optimized projects) while Rithm focuses more on the practical aspects of web development (fixing bugs, working on pre-existing codebases, code reviews from instructors). Is my assessment correct?

Thank you for any feedback"

codingbootcamp,My Experience With Trilogy Bootcamp So Far 3 Months In,1661014891,"So I'm taking the bootcamp Michigan State University is offering with Trilogy, and it's been 3 months since I started and it's been a struggle lately. This is coming from the perspective of someone who had no experience in actual coding before taking this class, the only coding I've ever used was LuaU, which is Roblox's version of Lua and is drastically different from the original Lua so I wouldn't count it as coding in my opinion. 

The main takeaway of this post is to give you guys an idea of what to expect if you are ever going to take a coding bootcamp from a University, most likely those bootcamps are run by Trilogy, or 2U, which are the same company now as they merged recently from what I heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**The interview**

* Before you sign up for the course, someone from the bootcamp calls you and asks you to complete an interview online and it was the most ridiculously easiest questionnaire ever. If you ever used a computer, you would be able to get all of the answers correctly.  You would have to pass this test in order to be admitted to the course, but if you have ever touched a computer or even a smartphone, you will definitely pass... I don't remember what the questions were, but it's related to how to use a computer properly, most of the questions had nothing to do with coding, just basic computer skills.

**The class activities**

* We use Zoom to attend class and Slack to send messages or resources. 
* The first week of the class, you start with the basics of HTML and then CSS and Javascript. The new things you learn every week are in pretty good progression where you learn those 3 basic languages for 6 weeks, then do a group project using everything you learned from those 6 weeks. This is also where you know to use Github to make commits and host the projects. We're near the 12-week mark where we will be doing our second project using everything we learned about the backend stuff such as Node.js, OOP, SQL, ORM, and MVC, and use either Postman or Insomnia for API testing. For the last 6 weeks, we will be going back to the front-end using React and PWA.
* Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are our schedules for 3 hours of learning the week's material. 
* On Thursdays, we go over the mini-projects for the class activities as the week's material ends and the instructor puts us in breakout rooms to work in a group as practice. Honestly, nobody actually works on this together but it's good practice to see how you learned for the week and what you need to continue to work on.

**The Homework assignments**

* You're required to turn in homework assignments every week using Github to host them and submit the links to the Canvas website. They do check for plagiarism from Github and give you 0s if you copy work. It's so easy to fall behind on work, I'm falling behind currently because I had to reset my computer and reinstall everything again, but I'm pretty sure they allow late assignments to be submitted. I'm guilty of plagiarising and got caught because of that. 
* You're only allowed to miss 2 assignments. According to what the TA said, this means 2 assignments that were never submitted, not late assignments. If I follow what he said, it probably means that you can submit assignments even after weeks after they were due and still get credit. So you can submit assignments even if it was due 2 months ago.
* This is what's frustrating, odd weeks the homework has starter codes already made that you can finish and know exactly what to do. Even weeks require you to make one from scratch. This is very complicated for backend stuff for me with stuff like OOP where they require you to make the homework from scratch, it's almost like you're required to copy from somewhere on Github in order to even start and hope you don't get caught because they don't give you anything start with.

**The pacing**

* So I'm taking the part-time class, which is 6 months from May to November. I don't think there ever was a full-time class for my bootcamp, this is a problem because the pacing is extremely fast even for part-time, and I personally am not able to absorb the material we are learning. I'm aware we're supposed to learn the material in our free time outside of class as well, but the activities they give us require someone to go through it with us together in order to understand what's even going on. 
* As I mentioned before, 3 hours of class time for those 3 days. This isn't enough time to fully comprehend the material because of the part-time schedule which makes the course fly by fast, and after that they let you go free. There are about 5 people in my class who has coding experience so it's a lot easier for them, out of around 30 people who are mostly struggling as I am.
* You will be overwhelmed if you don't have prior coding experience as I am currently. I'm trying to overcome this by watching a bunch of Youtube tutorials in my free time, but the class goes by so fast that it's so difficult to keep up with the pace. The whole point of the course is to get you to a new workplace as soon as possible and learn buzz words quickly to put on your resume. 

**The cost**

* My University's bootcamp costs $12k. I pay around 1k a month, but bootcamps in general cost around 10k-15k. This is not cheap by any means, I would not be able to afford this without my parents' help. 
* You're allowed to get your refund before the first week ends, but the first week all you learn is HTML and it will seem easy for the first few weeks, then it gets difficult after that and you'll feel trapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So should you attend?**

* What you're getting out of this bootcamp is mainly the most popular coding languages and 3 group projects to put on your resume. 

**Yes if you're...**

* If you're not able to do self-taught coding, this may be great for you because you have a team of people guiding you through exactly what you need to know. 
* If you're extremely disciplined and can put more than at least 12 hours a week of your free time learning the material on YouTube and other platforms. It's very easy to fall behind if you're not highly motivated and disciplined.
* If you already have prior experience in coding, this will be great for you to update your skills and knowledge.
* If you need to get into a new workplace in under a year, this bootcamp will make you qualified for a new job quickly.
* The certificate doesn't really matter, jobs won't ask you to show one but it's just nice to have to hang on your wall. What jobs are asking is to see any projects or Github work, and this bootcamp does exactly those for you. 

**No if you're...**

* If you're coming directly out of high school, you shouldn't attend because if you thought high school was overwhelming, this will take it to the next level with all of the knowledge you need to absorb in such a short amount of time. Take a break and discover what you really want to do.
* If you don't like working in groups, you should not attend. There's just no way to do this bootcamp without working together. The 3 projects you're required to do requires everyone to give in all their best effort because you're going to use those projects on your portfolio and resume.
* If you need more time for an explanation to understand something, you won't really do well. It's an open secret, but asking for more details in the course is not really encouraged because the instructor doesn't have time to slow down. There's only 3 hours of class and they have to finish covering the activities for the day within that 3 hours. Other classmates may also get frustrated if you keep the class holding back by asking questions because they're also on schedule, they may have to go to work right after class and can't be delayed for questions.
* If you have problems with your computer that may require you to reset your pc like I did, such as your SSD space filling up, you will definitely fall behind. For the 6 months of the course, don't factory reset your computer or work on something internally on your computer because some mishaps will occur and make you fall behind on class assignments. 
* If you struggle with speaking English, you'll struggle with the class. You're required to have a microphone and webcam to ask questions, without those you may get by if you have experience in coding, but you'll struggle a lot because you won't be able to ask questions you may have directly in the Zoom class.

I probably shouldn't have attended, but I was pushed by my parents to because I don't have any real skills that will get me into some kind of workforce. I just finished college and went straight to this bootcamp for some reason, college didn't prepare me for anything in my opinion. If you'd like to know, I graduated with a Finance degree and I'm currently doing nothing related to finance, and my school didn't prepare me with anything except to show that I went to their college.  2U, the company that owns Trilogy, is a publicly traded company so of course I understand they need to make money somehow with them buying up a bunch of other companies like Chegg. 

If you have any doubt about yourself taking a rigorous fast-paced coding course, think very hard about it before even attending so you don't regret taking it. Find out what else you want to do in life. There's a bunch of people in my class that probably shouldn't have taken it as well, but since we're halfway through the course, we might as well just go through with it because we already spent $6k for the class. 

The main reason why I can mostly do the bootcamp is because the TA and instructor are really experienced in this stuff and know what they're doing. I believe I'm getting what I'm paying for because my instructor and TA are great, they encourage everyone to participate by calling on random people to see if they know what's going on. I've heard nightmare stories from other people's experiences but I guess we're lucky we have great people here.

If you guys have any questions please post them and I'll try to reply my best to them."

Im currently researching coding bootcamps in NYC or fully online ones to start my career in coding!

I have been attempting to learn python on my own on MIMO the app, but I'm very unsure if self learning will get me a job.

codingbootcamp,Need advise on whether or not I should take the jump,1660887071,"Hi all! 

I’ve been lurking through this sub here the past few weeks and I think it’s time for me to make a decision. 

Since late 2019 i’ve been intrigued with the idea of joining a bootcamp and going into software dev. Of course since then, Covid (and life) has happened and i’m now in a position where I feel comfortable making a career change. 

I’ve been working in telecom sales and support my whole adult life (26M), and am in a role similar to an Account Exec at a SaaS company. I have 0 tech experience and no degree. 

In my current role i make around 95-105K a year, and realize that at least at first I would be taking something of a pay cut, but i’m wondering how much experience I would need to get closer to the 100K mark. I’ve also heard of folks getting job offers straight out of bootcamp, as well as horror stories from others that go almost a year without finding a job, and if they do it’s extremely low paying. 

I am looking more so for a self paced and flexible option, as I have plenty of time through my days to do bootcamp work, but my schedule changes daily (appointments and demos are booked on my behalf). Budget wise I am looking to stay in the bottom half (less than 7-8K total) and i’ve seen most of the self paced camps are on a monthly basis which is great. 

By searching this sub i’ve narrowed it down to a few options: Altcademy, NuCamp &amp; Udacity, but am super open to any recommendations, as well as any reviews from the ones i’ve looked into.

Our curriculum forces teamwork while we complete coding challenges and it's been a disaster for the most part. I found myself being the only one on certain teams that is not afraid to ask questions for better understanding or for help when I am stuck after a certain amount of time. I've experienced moments of awkward silences with no one asking questions or talking through the algorithm. I even had an advanced teammate (majored in CS in college) who left the Zoom room when I had a question which I thought was rude. When we had group projects, a few individuals treated it like a competition, flying through the instructions as quickly as they can, leaving behind the ones who are struggling rather than help them succeed. In my previous career, I trained people and always have encouraged questions and helping each other out.

-	I currently work in marketing and essentially manage our website via CMS.

-	 I know my way around HTML and CSS pretty r/well. I wouldn’t call myself an expert and I often have to look up code, but I am comfortable editing and changing these things on existing sites. I have never built anything from the ground up.

codingbootcamp,NYC in-person 16-week App Academy vs. 13-week General Assembly SWE bootcamp?,1660670228,"Hi all,

Just got into the two full-time programs mentioned above and am currently deciding between the two. Would love to hear any opinions on which one you guys think I should go for. 

Further, if anyone attended or knows someone who attended either course above, I would be very grateful if you would take some time and share your thoughts.

Currently I’m leaning App Academy, really simply because their admissions process was a lot more rigorous, with the 4 rounds of interviews including the live technical round I probably spent 10-20 hours prepping for, in which they tested in Ruby hashes, enumerables, etc. The general assembly interview process was a lot easier and shorter, and the technical stuff really only involved learning like 4 hours of basic HTML and CSS where they held my hand the whole time while learning and I never really needed to critically think. I know it’s not much to go off of, and the two syllabuses are really similar, but this is really why I’m leaning app Academy at the moment.

Further if anyone can link any real statistics on job placement rates and any other important stats for the two programs I would really appreciate it! (I’m well aware that the stats they advertise are misleading)

Thank you so much!"

codingbootcamp,Introduction to Swift Course,1660593895,"Hi all! My name is Karl,   

I've been reflecting on my journey (Apple retail employee to iOS Dev, to running Devmountain and ultimately starting Stateful). When I first started, I wanted the lifestyle that being a developer could give, and I wanted a path to help make my and others' lives better but didn’t know where to start.  

One of the significant feelings that have stuck with me is how much I wished for someone to give me a chance, ya know? Like, I felt I was smart enough to learn what I needed to learn, but I needed someone to believe in and support me.  

I realized that I’ve never done anything to help others that may be feeling the same way.  

So I made a course that’s more support than content. The Introduction to Swift Course will **not** be enough to become a full iOS developer, but It will give you the structure and momentum to accomplish your goals. It’s my answer to my old self of where to start.   

Hope it helps you - it’s free either way. Links to the course and our community discord - where you can talk to me directly - in the comments.  

Cheers!   Karl"

My current plan is continue working through App Academy's free open curriculum over the next academic year while I finish up a humanities degree, then dive into Harvard's CS50 course the following summer. If that goes well, I'm hoping to build on that foundation with either Springboard or Launch School after that. 

Ultimately, I would love to be able to pursue freelance work or entry-level start up positions in web dev and software engineering, with a focus on ed tech or international marketing (my background is in East Asian languages and teaching). My ideal program would be online, self-paced, and fairly thorough in covering fundamental skills and theory as well as specific tools. Thanks!!"

codingbootcamp,If I complete a coding bootcamp outside of US how would I get a job back in the states as a US citizen.,1660420876,"Hi, I am currently completing a coding bootcamp located outside of USA (in Europe). I moved to USA when I was 7 and have USA citizenship. I moved back to my home country just over a year ago and recently started a coding bootcamp which I am in the middle of right now. When I finish the bootcamp how do I go about applying for jobs. Do I apply from my country from Europe and then move back to the states when I land an offer. I have told this to a recruiter and they said that recruiters always put priority over local applicants than overseas applicants and if I am located outside of USA when I am applying that I would be considered overseas. It’s not like I am a foreigner trying to apply to jobs in USA as I do have US citizenship so I wouldn’t need to be sponsored or need visas though I don’t know if that makes a difference. The recruiter said I would need to move back to the states and apply from there. For me, It would be best for me to apply from where I am located right now and move to the states once I get hired to begin work. I don’t think I can just move to the states and basically blow through a bunch of money for all the time I’m living there while applying for jobs. Do you all think that I can apply from outside the US as a US citizen land a position and then move back?"

codingbootcamp,DevMountain coding bootcamp review,1660326624,"Hi! I went to DevMountain and I found a job a little more than halfway through the program - for that reason, I dropped out of the bootcamp. Here is my impression:

The first half of the bootcamp was extremely valuable *if* you were either *in person* or very skilled at online learning. Many folks who were fully online seemed to be very disengaged. The first half is called 'Foundations' and we basically learned how to make a website. Javascript, HTML, CSS, a very minimal amount of Python. The instructors I had were engaged and good teachers, even if sometimes a little unprepared. The lectures and slides that they do are standardized for courses and carried through cohorts, so the person teaching you didn't necessarily make the slides. Both of my instructors were DevMountain grads. They are not paid very well, so they presumably could not find jobs elsewhere.

We got to the second half and it moved to fully online. This is also where you're no longer eligible for any refund. We were given a new instructor for the specialty we chose. My instructor was a recent DevMountain grad with no professional experience or prior knowledge of our specialty. We were assigned 2-6 hours of videos per day to watch, which was extremely fatiguing. There were no formal lectures, and assignments were often not very well correlated to what were learning and/or not correct or well-made.

The students across different specialties often got together to ask if they were struggling as much as everybody was - students in every specialty had issues with how the second half of this bootcamp was run and with the quality of instructors.

We were assigned mentors (experts in the field) who met with us an hour a day. I brought up these concerns to my mentor, who confirmed that I was not the first to bring it up and that mentors had proposed changes in the past and that these suggestions had largely been ignored.

I'm grateful that I got a job about two weeks into this second half of the bootcamp because it wasn't going to provide me with anything valuable. The job that I got is not dev-related and my time in the bootcamp had no bearing on their decision to hire me (they didn't even know I was in a bootcamp). Not everybody had my luck and I'd be surprised if anybody got anything valuable out of the second half of the bootcamp.

After I left, I was kicked from the Discord servers and my license for Pluralsight was revoked (I was told that I would access to this for a year after the bootcamp). When I contacted them about it, they said it was because DevMountain is moving to a different platform, but that doesn't change the fact that I was told I would access to Pluralsight for a year.

I'm just going to add - every single instructor I interacted with was a DevMountain bootcamp grad. I imagine this boosts their post-graduating employment numbers. One of the Outcomes folks (the team responsible for helping students and graduates find jobs) was a bootcamp grad who still wanted to work in the field but was having trouble getting hired in the field.

Screenshots from my DMs: https://imgur.com/a/bqZhutW    
And screenshots from general student dissatisfaction: https://imgur.com/a/NXGue3E

**TL;DR:** I do not recommend this bootcamp. The first half was great and very worthwhile if you stay engaged and work hard, but the second half was hot garbage and you'd be better off (and less broke) learning on your own than doing DevMountain. Specializations weren't useful."

I currently have my eyes set on Rithm but their reply to my question about accommodations left me with a bad taste. I don’t have any issues learning, I pick up concepts easily, have gone through their practice questions with no problem, but exams really make my anxiety skyrocket to the point where it takes me a good 10 min to process the question. Which is what happened during their timed coding challenge (which I ended up solving within 5 min after it timed out). 

Their reply was essentially “recommend thinking through whether it’s the right fit for you,” but not outright saying “no we will not accommodate.” Which was disappointing since Rithm was the one school that seemed to value mental health. 

So, anyone have any bootcamp recs? I went through Codesmith’s prep program but ultimately decided I cannot do 6-days/week schedule due to health issues.

I think I’ve become burned out learning about things that are an absolute waste of time and do not pertain to my degree in any form. 

Yesterday I attended an open house for Coding Dojo. I understand not everyone has had a great experience with them, but not everyone has had an unpleasant experience either. It seems like with any boot camp, you get out what you put in. On top of that, CD seems to be the most affordable route for me while keeping the flexibility for work, homework, personal life, etc. 

For those that attended CD, what were the strengths, what did you like about them? On the other hand, what is something they could improve or what was something that you weren’t necessarily a fan of?

Any help is appreciated :)

Unfortunately, I’m just now hearing about universities making profit by using third party hosts such as 2U. I thought to share my experience with a coding bootcamp via a university near my city. It was a pretty intense course, we had 4 hour lectures everyday for 12 weeks, two hours of tutoring sessions a week, TAs, extra student support like an advisor, and we used slack to communicate with the class, professors, mentors etc. For someone that procrastinates and studying doesn’t come easy for me, somethings are hard to retain for me. I made it through but with lots of help. During the bootcamp it was about 2-3 times that I cried my eyes out saying wtf this class is hard, I wanna drop it. I managed to pull through. My classmates definitely helped me get through it as well. The group projects boosted my grade giving me a chance to do poorly on some homework assignments. 

Anyways, I also wanted to ask since this is where I am in life

I found some bootcamps who specifically focuses on DevOps tools and practices for job specific skills. I am suprised that there aren't many bootcamps out there specifically focus on Devops. Most of them are fullstack or data engineering etc. Is it harder to learn DevOps tools and practices without going through the fullstack curriculum first?

With economy is not doing so good lately and hiring in tech is slowing down, what are the chances of me completing a DevOps bootcamp and be able to get hired after? Bootcamp i plan to attend is a job specific tailored and not as reputable as the ones out there like hack reactor or app academy etc. My friend who attended and found a job fairly quickly was very happy with them but also said the more time and effort the greater the outcome is which i don\`t think i will have any problem there since i am very willing to make that career change for the future.

Do you think the name of the bootcamp make any impact during hiring process especially with no previous degree or background? Especially economy and hiring freezes all over the news is making me a little nervous about investing in a bootcamp during this time.

Hi. I am a junior studying Econ. I currently have very bad GPA, and I don't enjoy Economics much. I only have an year left to graduate, but because of my terrible GPA and depressing extracurricular activity, I don't see my self getting any jobs after graduation. I am thinking about moving back to my home state, and going to community college to transfer to my state school for CS. I wish that I can transfer directly to my state schools' CS program, but because of my bad GPA, I don't think I can. I thought about boot camp or self taught root to become software engineer, but bootcamp cost too much and self taught root seems very challenging. Moreover, imo CS degree will provide more chance to get in to the software engineering industry. Fortunately, I am 90 percent sure that I can go to state schools in my state for free.

The school that I currently attend is some what prestigious private school. My state has one of the best CS school, but I do not think I can transfer there with my current school's GPA bringing the average down. I agree that the degree from more prestigious schools provide more opportunity, so I feel like I am throwing my degree away. Am I being stupid and delusional by Quitting my current school? If I want to become SWE what is the best action I can take?"

codingbootcamp,Since my DMs are literally flooded with questions about Codesmith/transitioning to a CS career after 30/everything else - will host an AMA a soon,1659497897,"Hello all - 

If you’ve messaged me recently in my DMs (which are always open), it’s possible I may not have gotten back to you yet. I’ve been entirely unable to keep up. 

Since my job has been very demanding of most of my time and I don’t foresee the ability to converse at length with everyone soon, I’d like to host an AMA twice (so those who can’t make it to one will hopefully make it to another). 

As someone who doesn’t use social media other than Reddit (and I’m not even on here much), I’m not sure the easiest way to do this - any ideas? For my personal safety I will continue to remain anonymous, as I’ve had multiple Reddit accounts end in deletion because of stalking concerns. So no video - would prefer some sort of live chat option if possible. 

Topics will include but are not limited to:
Codesmith 
Transitioning careers at/over 30 years old
Experiences with other bootcamps and learning to code
Etc!

Feel free to ask any (appropriate) question. Anyone being inappropriate will be asked to leave/muted/ignored. 

If you know a way for me to host this, please let me know and I’ll be sure to get two on the calendar. 

Thanks!

PS - Michael (you know who you are) I am certain you will see this and feel free to show up or not, but I’m absolutely not going to allow you to promote your company during this AMA - it’s neither relevant nor appropriate. But you can ask Codesmith questions in it, as you always seem to have plenty."

codingbootcamp,Which WITCH or differed tuition bootcamp is the best way to go??,1659467799,"I need a job soon. My work history is a mess and I just started studying programming roughly 4 months ago. I know html, css, javascript, a bit of react and python that i'm not too comfortable doing. In my opinion I need to take advantage of one of these pay as you learn situations as they seem to be less risky than joining a bootcamp and putting all my eggs in one basket that says I will be hired after the bootcamp to cover the no doubt 15 to 20k debt the bootcamp will put me in. I just want a more gaurenteed route, I've looked up bootcamps like tech elevator and coding temple and sabio. I just don't want to put myself in debt for no reason. I've also looked into the WITCH programs such as infosys, cognizant, hcl etc. The only con to that is relocation would be crazy I don't even have 500 dollars to my name at the moment so moving to a whole new state sounds a bit crazy to me. I live in florida so there is the silver lining that there could be clients here since this is the east coast and I've heard tampa is a bit of a hub for tech companies. I guess I just want a bit of advice , I just want something more definite. I'm not afraid of pouring hours and hours into learning aslong as I know that learning will pay off. Also I have used resources such as freecodecamp the odin project and the havard csx50 course. Right now in freecodecamp I am learning more javascript which seems kind of easy but it hasn't completely set in yet. Also I've looked into apprenticeships like generation and other sponsored ones in florida and am open to them aswell. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I want some advice on what route to go deferred tuition bootcamp or WITCH company, and what is the best option in each respected routes, I have no degree and only know html, css, and javascript but need work relatively soon and want to pursue work in the tech industry."

codingbootcamp,Hack Reactor TAA - Questionable Pass Rate (?),1659388792,"I took Hack Reactors Technical Admissions Assessment (TAA) last week Friday and felt pretty good. Got to question 13 (out of the 14 possible), and felt rather solid on my answers. Looking back, I made a few mistakes, but all the test functions they gave me passed. 

When they called me today to tell me that I had been accepted into the program, I specifically asked the pass rate of their TAA. The guy said he didn't have the info. Which is fine, up until I looked into what other redditors got over the last couple years, even found someone who posted earlier this year. Some folks were getting 7-9 right and getting in. 

Listen, I get it. Everyone learns differently, and especially tests differently. But if someone is getting to question 7 and getting accepted, I am concerned. For those that have not taken the Hack Reactor TAA, it is a 55 minute assessment of various JS problems that ramp up in difficulty. It is designed to not be completed, and is graded on the code and verbal walk through. Verbally talking about what you have done, even on the smaller questions, is the huge bottleneck here. 

The 7th question is really the 3rd or 4th (some questions are just test cases that works to remind you of a method or other concept), and is either a simple debugging question or a low level math equation that you have to make work in JS. Even getting up to the 9th question right just deals with arrays and objects. Now, I will admit that I have been doing a lot of practice on my own, but their prep program on JS covers all this in detail to crush this test. 

To me, this does not make me want to be a part of the program as I feel that they are accepting less than ideal candidates, which is immoral as all hell as they are setting them up for failure. Makes me think the program is not as rigorous or worth it to compensate.

What are your guys thoughts? Has Hack Reactors standards dropped? Am I looking into things more than I should?

Any other bootcamps that you would recommend?"

Hence took some time over the weekend (or 2) and developed a small extension. Sharing it with the community hoping others will find it useful. For now it works on leetcode. Will try to make it work on other platforms as well.

However after some soul searching I realized too late that I enjoy programming and the problem solving aspect. But my degree did not prepare me for more advanced CS concepts like data structures and algorithms or doing multiple projects. We learned how to use Python and SQL in my technical classes, I took classes focusing on data analytics; big data, business intelligence, business programming, and an MIS class (we used data analytic libraries, mostly Pandas). I interviewed for a full stack position and it went really well until I did the technical interview and totally bombed. I’ve been out of school for an month now, for now I am planning on finding a job as a business analyst or an IT systems position. Im ready to move on from the beginner programming stage into the intermediate stage but I don’t know how to get there on my own. I’m currently working on a small beginner personal project in Python on my own no tutorials.

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp or Degree. Beginner can't choose what direction to go,1659154644,"Hey everyone, I need advice

To summarize how I got the idea to get into software engineering, I am 19 and just graduated high school. I realized I wanted to live abroad eventually and be a digital nomad and hopefully within the next five years. Looked at common digital nomad jobs but a lot of them are more freelance work then actually working for a company, which is fine but don't think I would be comfortable being strictly freelance virtual assistant for example. But every list online has software engineering as a common digital nomad job which also pays well on average in comparison to the other jobs. 

However I don't have professional coding experience as I am just going into the ""real world"" you could say. I've done a lot of research on whats its like to be software engineer, success stories and the opposite. And when looking around online you either see ""I went to this bootcamp and got a job X months later that pays 100k"" or you see ""coding bootcamps are a waste and you can learn all of it by yourself and if companies don't see a degree they skip your resume."" 

So, if I am hoping to be a software engineer with good pay for a digital nomad (50k+) within the next 5 years should I learn as much as I can on my own and try to go to a top bootcamp or should I learn all i can then go for a Bachelors degree?

I am an ME (mechanical engineer), but I really really want to transition to software as it is the future. I took Matlab course and I had a terrible time on the course, to the point I really struggled to write code. For some reason, coding was something I struggled a lot to understand and write, but then I am taking difficult courses like heat transfer and thermodynamics and solving problems! I don't know, but I always seem to learn better if I can recognize a pattern or get a hands on learning, otherwise I struggle a lot.

For coding, I want to learn but I realize I am someone who really needs the hands on 1-1 more and then I learn a lot better if you can show the patterns for codes and how to write them. That way I am able to understand better. Maybe this is me, but that is how I learn. For all these coding bootcamps, how do I pick one that focuses on teaching like this? Can anyone advise here? I really want to pursue software, I dont wish to continue going through ME because the money and career growth is much much more in software."

codingbootcamp,Desperately need advice,1658881965,"Background/My situation: I was going into veterinary but due to my health have realized that's not possible. I need a job that is flexible and work from home, so I can have breaks to lie down and also have a comfortable desk setup. So I've fallen upon my second passion, coding. I've been interested since I was in gradeschool messing around with Python and Scratch but only recently have I been getting serious about it and going through codecademy and The Odin Project. I really need a job and since I don't have a ton of time...

Current: I've been thinking about a bootcamp. Because even if I don't get a high paying job, I will hopefully at least get one. I need a part-time option (due to the high intensity of full time and my health issues) and something with an income share agreement or something similar to where I don't pay until I have a job as I don't have the money to pay upfront or before I get a steady income.

Bootcamp Options: I've looked into a few but many only have reviews I could find from minimum 3yrs ago... my top picks so far are Hack Reactor and App Academy. I have a friend currently in General Assembly but to me they seem a bit sketch just from my interactions with them but I could very much be wrong.

Thank you so much for any advice or your experience with any of this :)"

codingbootcamp,Mimo_Dev: an on-going review,1658540193,"Like myself, a number of you have wondered aloud about the new [web development boot camp at Mimo.](https://dev.getmimo.com/)

Today I signed up for the boot camp after having secured a 20% discount.\* I went back and forth on whether or not I should go for something like [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) or [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/), but Mimo made sense in the respect that I could go through this bootcamp and come out debt free on the other side. Additionally, I would be learning the same material that I would at the other camps I just mentioned. At least when it comes to front end development.

Given that there isn't a lot of material out there about Mimo\_Dev, I wanted to go ahead and get that review snowball rolling. I'm sure those of you who are signed up can come up with reviews of your own, but I thought I would at least get the conversation started. Here's what I've learned so far:

**Curriculum**

Right off the bat, when you sign up for Mimo\_Dev you're given an opportunity to complete Pre-work material. This is entry level course work on HTML and CSS, with various ""proficiency projects"" you can complete to hone your skills. This pre-work is not required but it is encouraged to be completed as it will set you up to be more prepared once your class starts.

The class will go forth in weekly sprints which will cover a particular topic. These topics will include, but are not limited to, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, Node.js, and final projects including building a CRUD app.

**Platform**

The Mimo\_Dev platform is very similar to what you would expect in the Mimo app. It's this very continuity that convinced me to join because everything feels like it was handcrafted, rather than borrowing from other online resources. Mimo\_Dev does use the Notion platform to explain certain development topics at length, but all of the exercises, practice material, and projects are contained within the Mimo\_Dev environment. It's very thoughtfully designed.

**Class**

I have limited knowledge on this aspect given that I've just signed up, but I'll be editing this post to include my experience with my advisors and peers.

**Location**

Given that the Mimo company is based in Austria, there is a time difference to consider when it comes down to staying in touch with advisors who are most likely working from a European time zone. But for the most part the company seems to be aware of this fact and has protocols in place to meet the needs of students in the US.

**So far...**

Overall I'm impressed with the platform so far. It looks like Mimo has finally found a way to provide students with an intensive web development experience from its own backyard, rather than having to partner with Bloomtech or Strive School (as they did in the past). The infrastructure appears to be solid and I'm eager to see how the class work unfolds as we learn and build projects together.

As I mentioned above, I'll be updating this post as I go, so feel free to save this and review it later on. I'll comment below when I've made any changes that may be worth looking into. 

^(\*Pro-tip: you can secure a discount yourself if you become a pro user of the Mimo app. Just work your way through the app and a discount for the boot camp should become available to you. This is, of course, subject to Mimo's terms and policies.)"
codingbootcamp,Part time mornings,1658530767,"Disclaimer: this is not a discussion on if programming boot camps are worth it. I have done my research on that and I think the structure would be useful for me. I have taught myself python and some Django (with a little bit of html and css thrown in) and I’m looking for structure to learn the ins and outs of full stack development (preferably javascript but I’m interested in Django or java as a backend).
———————————————————— 
So I’m looking for a bootcamp that is part time in the mornings. The main reason I’m considering a boot camp is the “face to face” interaction with an instructor who has professional experience (does not have to be in person). With that being said I would like a course with some sort of Skype or teams interaction with the instructor.

codingbootcamp,Debunking App Academy's 16 week in person myth's,1658530396,"Hi everyone, there is a lot of miss information regarding App Academy's in person 16 week program and I just am here to settle some common misconceptions 

1. A/A's passing the technical interview does not mean you are prepared for the bootcamp!
   1. Yes this is true , but that is because once you are accepted into the bootcamp, you are not actually accepted into the bootcamp. The first two weeks of the bootcamp are called foundations. You must pass both assessments in order to enter the ""in person"" section. If you do not pass you are able to be deferred to the next cohort, and if you fail another foundations assessment you will be removed from the program and given a 100% refund. here is the screenshot for the second tests learning objectives. [test 2](https://imgur.com/a/TBTMSWD)  In my opinion the second test is harder than any technical interview any bootcamp gives. 
2. A/A wants to kick you out!
   1. This is also not true. Most tests are either on Monday or Tuesday. The week before, they will give you a study guide similar to the foundations test above, and they will also give a practice assessment the week before that is similar in difficulty to the real one. There are 6 in person tests, and you are able to completely flunk 1. And if you fail another, you will be given a retake of the same assessment later that day. (you will literally have all the questions). So in actuality you really only have to pass 4/6 on your first try. 
   2. Each test is done via TTD. You will be given problems with specs that need to pass. Even if you cannot answer the question generally each question has ""free"" specs that can be passed. For example declaring the function correctly generally passes a spec. So if a test is 6 questions, with 13 specs and only 10 are needed to pass. You will only need to answer 4 of the questions correctly, while you can get partial credit on the other 2 to get the total number of specs needed to pass."

1. What was the support system like at Hack Reactor from the staff? 
2. Were instructors engaging and easy to follow along? 
3. If students are struggling, do instructors spend extra time with the student to grasp the content? 
4. After the course was completed, did you feel like you truly understood the topics that were taught or did you feel lost/overwhelmed? 
5. How helpful were/are the career search support services?

codingbootcamp,Full Stack Boot Camp-New Horizons?,1658340140,"I'm looking for any and all feedback about my fantastical journey into a junior development role. Why is this fantastic? Because it seems more like a fantasy than a reality.

I have a strong liberal arts background (this is what you sarcastically call a BA) and don't have a lot of anxiety about my ability to learn languages. I've developed and deployed some really basic scripts, I can work via the command line, I've run my own unmanaged server: nothing I have done has been complicated or technical, but all of the ideas and techniques I have had to hack together have all made sense. I think I can learn.

But, I don't know if it makes a lot of sense for me to try to enter this field using a boot camp. The boot camp is crazy expensive, but I qualify via the VA's VRRAP program, so it's basically free. But the criteria to get in are basically pulse, funding from uncle sugar. It's not what you would call a selective program.  


Here's the program outline:  


Week 1- Intro to Python

Week 2- Advanced Python

Week 3-Introduction to Java

Week 4- Advanced Java/JSP

Week 5- Introduction to HTML5/ CSS3

Week 6- Introduction to Javascript &amp; Advanced HTML 5 /CSS3

Week 7- Introduction to MERN

Week 8- Advanced MERN

Week 9&amp; 10 Advanced Capstone Project

&amp;#x200B;

My personal connections in this field do not exist. I have no relationships to leverage that would get my foot in the door, and I don't really know if it makes sense for anyone to hire me after I complete this boot camp. I have carefully read about trying to reskill via boot camps, and I am aware that there are a few lines of thought about this:

""Boot Camps are a Waste of Time."" This does not seem to be true, entirely, but there are stories, often untold, of other people in coding boot camps that are unable to obtain employment after graduation. If this were me, and I spent $10,000 on a boot camp, I probably would not go onto Reddit and brag about it

&amp;#x200B;

""Boot camps are a great way for people with STEM degrees to change careers."" My undergraduate degree does not have any of the word that make up the acronym STEM in it. Does it make sense for someone with a liberal arts degree to try to market themselves as a junior developer in waiting after attending a ten week boot camp? Would YOU hire me?  


""Boot camps do not get you experience, they just show you the ropes."" How does someone with no experience that is marketable get one's foot in the door? And, with the course outline above, what are the odds of finding work if I don't have SQL but instead have mongo? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can do the work and learn some basic skills, but my ability to market myself locally-I have a wife and 3 kids, I'm not moving anywhere-is going to be the shortcoming in my misadventure.  


Like I said, the program is fully funded, but I feel like the idea of ""I can afford this!"" is easily confused with ""this is going to work!"""

Would this defeat the purpose of doing the bootcamp in another area or would I still have a good shot getting jobs there even though I’d be on the other side of the country?"

codingbootcamp,"Compliance/Finance into Coding, Worth Taking the leap?",1658263413,"Have been considering making the leap for the last couple of years and wanted some input on potential positions/roles I could go for with my existing experience + bootcamp.

Some background: late 20s, currently working at mid-tier bank doing BSA/AML compliance and controls testing. 6 years of relative experience in that field with 130k salary. I just don’t think I’m made for the typical old-fashion finance industry and have been trying to move into crypto/fintech but it’s been difficult.

coding/developing always intrigued me, I think theres similarities in what my work currently requires me to do, and what I would need in order to be good in the industry. I’m also worried about future proofing my career and feel like tech is the safest bet.

I understand that I’ll probably take a paycut in the beginning but hoping I’ll catch up quickly in terms of growth and opportunity.

I still have student loans and have to be financially independent so will definitely be taking a part-time bootcamp (please lmk if you have recs)

I guess my questions are: whether it’s really worth to make the jump right now, are there any types of roles where my previous experiences can help add to being a developer rather than just becoming a waste and if I should even bother doing a bootcamp if I can only do it part-time?

Thanks in advance!"

I am relying on the support of my partner so money is tight.

I personally am attending App Academy on Monday because I want an in person experience and rather not wait till the end of October to start. But I have been accepted into AA, Codesmith, and Hack Reactor and want to share insights from a non codesmith truther.

To start: CSX fucking sucks: if your brand new to programming, because it is challenging, but does not provide a strong enough base, and their solution videos suck if you don’t have a strong base to go on. Personally I believe CSX is designed this way to sell their CS/JSB beginner programs because you don’t learn anything from going through CSX. 

How do you prepare for CSX. 

1. Eloquent JS chapters 1-14. Read and take notes. 
2. Freecodecamp OOP and basic JS found in their JS curriculum 
3. Freecodecamp YouTube on:
-recursion 
-dynamic programming
-higher order functions 


If you put effort into the recourses I listed above you will hit less road blocks and be able to work through the sections actually understanding what’s going on. 

I personally tried to learn through CSX as my main resource and wasted a lot of time"
codingbootcamp,I used to run a coding boot camp. Some advice and a help request,1657997728,"Howdy,

I used to run a coding boot camp that focused on Blockchain.  I called it MerkleSchool ( the google ranking is still up ).  This was back in 2018.  I'm a Sr. Dev from big tech, and I ran the school solo out of a coworking space.  I've seen some of the threads and questions here, and I have some advice for those wishing to use a code bootcamp, online resources, and other ideas on how to learn to code.  I also have a help request, and figured this post would make a fun give-and-take.

The give:

Learning to code is hard for some people, and not hard for others.  The big difference is how much you know about computers prior to learning to code.  And by that, I mean at different layers of abstraction.  The first is the idea of memory partitions.  This idea is used everyplace as a proxy for other ideas around distributed processing.  Let's pretend you're going to do a full stack web app -- say you're going to copy amazon.com.  Well, that's not complicated, but it's very complicated at the same time.  If you understand that a real service like AMZN has a front-end, a middle layer, and a back-end all running on different physical infrastructure; that you are *simulating that environment* locally via memory/process partitions and that the information in memory is different at each layer, and you're sending messages between different memory partitions -- it'll be easier to learn how to code.  This is especially important if you're doing full stack in a single language like NodeJS.  In fact, I don't recommend doing full stack in a single language, because the memory partition as proxy for infrastructure division problem gets really bad for some learners.


Another thing that I've seen is troubleshooting your computer via a command shell.  One thing I have seen a lot, and this includes in new college hires with CS degrees, is that they don't understand how things like loading a process works.  This is fine -- until something goes wrong and you're trying to do an assignment, and fighting your computer at the same time.  For this reason, I don't recommend a coding bootcamp to anyone who can't boot a linux computer and install an app via bash.  Figure out how to setup something complex -- say Jupyter notebooks and tensorflow in a virtual system of some sort from scratch ( either a VM or a container ).  Just do hello world -- the code's already written for you -- it's the act of learning how to install stuff and use a command shell that's the important exercise.


There are some other items that are important.  Programming is a ""High-G"" sport.  That is to say, there really is a minimum IQ, working memory, frustration management, and inherent curiosity requirement to learn it. I'd wager that only 35% of the population has the capability to learn it.  It's got nothing to do with school performance, and a lot to do with abstraction/memorization capability.  And, in fact, it's probably closer to language skill/vocabulary acquisition capability than math.  If you're the kind of person that could learn a foreign language like French or Japanese, then you likely have the required ""G"".  Being good at algebra is a poor predictor -- it's more like learning to talk to the computer and being able to model the ""mind"" of the computer.  Math has simply been the ""G Proxy"" commonly used in academia, even when it doesn't make sense.


Programming requires experimentation to learn.  Lots of trial and error, with lots of failure.  So much failure.  I've seen students have very minor failures -- failures that wouldn't frustrate me in the slightest and I view as normal -- give up because of the small failures.  If you can't manage the emotion of frustration from trying again and again -- programming is not a good fit for your personality.  The difference between a good programmer and a bad one is emotional -- the good one handles frustration well and does trial/error even though they're beating their head against a wall.  The good ones eventually learn to celebrate the little victory when they figure something out -- no matter how trivial.  I spent all of yesterday installing a single library.  A single library.  Every installation failed at run-time in weird ways because of conflicts with other libraries.  I eventually got it installed and running, and you bet that was something I celebrated.


Google is a skill.  Programming is a lot of frustration because a lot of the information is wrong or outdated.  It's why I like Go so much -- that backward compatibility guarantee means documentation and examples will work even 2 years later.  It's why I hate NodeJS -- because library functions move around, sometimes between packages -- for no apparent reason, and documentation is always out of date.  Being able to use Google well -- to find solutions to the constant stream of failures -- is critical.

Between a boot camp and online learning - the boot camp wins hands down.  The Pandemic happened, and the research is now conclusive -- for almost all people, online is a worse learning environment -- even online, live, and instructor lead.  There are just too many friction points that will cause you, the student, to use working memory (which is very finite in a human) or frustration management (again, finite resource) online vs in person.  Your best bet to actually learn in a reasonable time is in an in-person, instructor-paced setting.  The real problem is that programming is just not a profession that's a good fit for the majority of people.  The fact that you think it's a good fit for you (or you wouldn't be thinking about a boot camp) is a good indicator that it is actually a good fit for you.  But, you won't know if you can handle the frustration until you try.


The take:

Now, my ask.  I find I like looking for solutions with other programmers.  At work, we often ""coach each other"" through problems.  It'd be nice to be able to do that at home, not just at work, when I screw around learning to program something new.  A ""matchmaking"" service where I could hop in, send a ""I'm working on X, who wants to join me"" request, then match with another programmer with the same interest so we could pair program for an hour or two here or there.  Does anyone know of such a service (one that isn't a scam)?"

It is true what they say ""surround yourself with great minds"" and I've surely enjoyed all the learnings and time-spent with all my professors and mentors. It was an excellent program packed with core project management skills, Harvard Business case studies, and group capstone projects. After 6 months of multiple courses (Project Management, Agile Management, Project Risk Management, Quality Management, Lean six sigma green belt LSSGB, Digital Transformation, Design Thinking, Customer experience design, and Leadership Skills), I’ve finally realized the goals I had set out for myself and feel incredibly proud of this achievement.

I have seen a few boot camps like appAcademy which will defer your tuition till you get a job making over, however, they say they will take 15% of your salary for 3 years which seems rediculous to me given I could make over 50k at my current job if I did more overtime.

codingbootcamp,Imposter Syndrome or just genuinely bad?,1657294559,"Hello all, I'm currently enrolled in the UNC Charlotte Bootcamp and we are over half way done with everything. We just finished our 2nd big project and feel like I'm way behind everybody else. My grades aren't the worst but could definitely be better, but this group project really brought this to my attention. tl;dr at the bottom.  


My other (5 total) group members basically carried all of the work. I did a few things, but I was mostly referencing our in-class assignments while the others seemed to know off their heads what to write and where to write it. I would say the workload between me and the other 4 to be about 90%/10% split and I feel pretty ashamed. They talk about how good we all did and that we all worked so hard, but I really didn't do much.  


A good example of this is that while 2 of us were working on one part of the project, a single group member did all of the CSS work on his own. I mean ALL of it, and he just suddenly did a git push request and showed about 700+ lines of code. I get he didn't physically type all of it (bootstrap, tailwind, etc.) but he still found what needed to be put and tweaked things here and there.

&amp;#x200B;

Our instructors told us we can start applying for tech positions now and classmates have gotten tech interviews already. I've tried doing Leetcode and even the most basic of javascript questions had me totally lost. I had to google just about everything, even a simple for loop. I get what imposter syndrome is but there is definitely a difference between imposter syndrome and just being genuinely bad at something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not completely lost. I do understand a bunch of what we've learned, but I just feel way behind everybody else and not pulling my weight in this project is what pushed me here. Sorry for ranting, I just need advice. They offer tutoring here but I wouldn't even know what to ask a tutor. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I didn't pull my weight in a recent group project and struggled with the parts I did help with; 90%/10% workload split. Tried leetcode and couldn't solve the most basic javascript problems."

codingbootcamp,I attended a 2U Coding Bootcamp and this is what happened,1657142835,"Around 9 months ago, I walked out on my job that I had loved and worked at for almost 3 years. It was in the restaurant industry. The hours were long and the job sometimes really demanding, but I did enjoy it. Unfortunately, the work environment changed drastically at a certain point, prompting me to make my leave. I had NO IDEA what I was going to do next, but I remember my friend mentioning a buddy of his took some bootcamp thing and ended up with a well-paying job as a SWE. 

So I looked into it, and before long, was on the phone with a representative from 2U (the bootcamp was through the University of New Hampshire). Sidenote: it seems like a lot of shade gets thrown on 2U for using a university name. I don't understand this. It is made abundantly clear when you enroll that there is a separate entity running the bootcamp and that you're not actually getting an instructor from the university. However, it's important to note that these details are largely irrelevant when it comes to the quality of the course as that has more to do with the material being taught. I would argue the material is the same just about everywhere (including free online sources).

I started my coding journey two months before my first class. I used [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) (and you should, too) to get a really good head start. I had coded my own Blackjack browser game by the first day. In other words, I prepared (perhaps a bit overkill) for the class and didn't expect it to be a cake walk. Well, being that I already knew some JavaScript, the fact that Week 1 was just HTML put me in a good spot. For the majority of the class, I actually kept this pattern up. During most of the course, I was about 2-3 weeks ahead of the class. The only reason I was able to do this was because of that head start with [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I think this is integral to expediting the process of breaking into a new career. Show up on the first day with some knowledge you found on your own and you'll be in great shape. This is a good segue into my next point:

The admissions counselor told me it was 10 hours class time per week, plus 10-20 hours of time outside of class. I guarantee that if you follow this pattern, you will be just fine. The problem is, most people don't, and you can't blame them. For people with families, full-time jobs, and various other commitments, the idea of spending another 20-30 hours a week doing something else is unreasonable, and at times, impossible. This doesn't mean that you'll fail without investing all this time, but you'll have a very difficult time if you don't spend a lot of your days learning to code. I've seen some complaints about how the course ""leaves a lot of gaps for you to fill in"". The idea is the gaps get filled in during your independent time (10-20 hours per week). You need to be self-sufficient at times. They also offer tutoring and my instructors were often available for questions in Slack any day of the week. And to my next point:

You need to enjoy it. At least at some level. You need to get some satisfaction out of solving problems or making visuals with code or making tight data models or designing clean REST APIs or whatever it is that makes you feel less dead inside. Chances are there is something in software that you slot perfectly into, but rarely is anyone going to tell you what that is. That's something you need to find and work at for yourself.  


That being said, the Career Services offered by the bootcamp are amazing. I'm not sure every bootcamp has this as an option, but I was given the opportunity to speak with professionals about what recruiters are looking for and how to craft my resume/online brand in such a way that appealed to them. In addition to this, I was assigned a personal Career Director who met with me weekly to discuss where I was at with the job search. She actually was the one who told me to apply to the job I have today. This is a service you can pay for elsewhere, but it was really nice to have it embedded into the program. I also felt like they genuinely wanted me to succeed (of course that's their job but still nice).  


In conclusion, I've noticed a lot of criticism surrounding bootcamps so I wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it would help others who have already invested or are thinking about investing in a new career. You will most likely NOT get a SWE career just by showing up to class, turning in assignments on time, and paying tuition. But if you take the time to apply the things you learn in class, build projects of your own, or read documentation just because you're curious, you'll have the makings of a great developer.  


TLDR;  
You can become a developer (and even get employed) after a 24-week long bootcamp. However, much of your progress is dependent on your consistency and, just as importantly, your interest with the material.

Now the problem is that i am kinda anxious that i will not be able to find a job in animation or art as i am kinda mediocre at it and my interest over the particular subject has faded over the years. That is why i was considering studying programming and learning how to code. I have done some self studying over the last months but i am never able to complete a full course as i lack the motivation and competence required. So i have been considering joining a bootcamp by next september. Because i am from Greece my options are very limited so i was thinking about an online part-time or full-time bootcamp. Do you guys have any suggestions? What would the best most reputable bootcamp be to almost guarantee a job after some months. I think i would mostly prefer javascript and python as i have noticed that these two are the most sought after languages in the current tech industry. Some of the bootcamps i have take an interest in: Coding dojo, Codeworks, General Assembly, Hack Reactor. Also i would like some advice for the ISA payment method. Where you pay only after you have gotten a job.  Is this payment method reliable and is it worth it  in the longrun?  And lastly i am a bit concerned that  a full time program is going to be  way too intense, and there will not be much time to actually remember what you have learnt, so maybe part time is better. Appreciate any help and advice."

Specifically, I want to (at least start out learning, but if there are other languages that have good resources feel free to let me and other readers know) learn python, all of the C's (C,C+,C++,C#, etc.) and possibly even javascript. Pretty much anything that could help me develop software or apps.

codingbootcamp,Looking for a coding course with good mentor/TA support,1656993564,"Hi all,

After reading all the posts about why NOT to pay 15k+ for a bootcamp, I decided to try to study coding on my own. However, there are times when I wanted a more experienced person to help me review my code and to point out the potential problems with the code. I also want to have a mentor whom I can ask questions for clarifications on the harder topics. So far I think Udacity and Teamtreehouse both seem ok to me. They are not expensive and offer mentor support.

codingbootcamp,Is Altcademy legit?,1656936874,"I've looked up reviews for Altcademy, and although the reviews look great on the surface, if you look at the reviews more closely, they seem a little sketchy to me. On CourseReport, they get 5 stars from 100 reviews, but if you filter it down to verified reviews, there are only 5. If you go down that rabbit hole and look at other online bootcamps with roughly 100 reviews, they all have about 50% verified reviews.

When you compare the Altcademy reviews on CourseReport, CareerKarma and Switchup, many of the reviews are just copy and pasted onto each review site. I compared that with another program such as Launch School. Launch school has 85 reviews on CourseReport with 47 of them verified, and if you look at their reviews on other sites, the reviews aren't just copy/pastes from CourseReport.

Lastly, why are there absolutely ZERO video reviews/interviews of graduates and/or students on YouTube? Where are the Medium and Twitter posts of graduates? If there's been one common thing about learning to code, it's blogging your learning journey. Altcademy is supposedly one of the top online bootcamps, and I can't find anything other than copy/paste reviews on the sites mentioned above. There are even fewer posts on Reddit about Altcademy."

codingbootcamp,Professional poker player with a Masters in Accounting/Finance and zero work experience in 7 years wanting to get into the 9 to 5 world. Data science an option?,1656901946,"
So I finished my MS in accounting and finance back in 2015 and chose to play professional poker for a living for the past 7 years. I did it for the comfort and freedom but I think I can’t do it for much longer. It’s been an exhausting ride and I want to make the transition to a real world job for more stable income and a healthy 401k when I retire.

Some friends suggested I look at this thing called “data science” and “coding” and finish some online courses/get a certificate of some kind or maybe even do some bootcamp to get started. 

I have a few questions:

1) Is it worth the time/effort to pursue this? I don’t want to end up spending time trying to learn this only to be turned down at interviews later because I have such a gap on my resume. What are the hiring prospects for someone like me?

2) How do I even figure out if I would enjoy this career? I know nothing about it. I only studied computer science for 2 years (remember learning C++) in my undergrad but remember nothing. Know no other languages.

3) Are there any alternative careers you guys would recommend instead if not data science?

My biggest concern is how easy/hard it’ll be to find a job once I get a certificate or something. 

Any input is highly appreciated, thanks guys!"

codingbootcamp,How can I use my background in my favor?,1656614868,"I'm finishing my bootcamp and would love any advice or insights from this community.

I'm a first-generation latina in the US and have a degree back home in International Relations. During college and since graduating I've worked different and unrelated jobs: teaching English, working at a cultural exchange agency (mostly for speaking English) and a firm working with wealthy families to establish their Family Offices (the most challenging/interesting one so far). I've also traveled abroad a lot and worked as an Au Pair in the US for more traveling/English practice and just the cultural immersion, and stayed - and I'm authorize to work here so that's not an issue.

The point is, I obviously am as far from coding as possible. The only time I completely focused on it was this year when I started my bootcamp in January. I feel embarrassed for my resume honestly since it's all over the place and I can't find many transferable skills that employers want. As a result, like many here I have Impostor Syndrome and feel insecure about the job search.

I've been accepted into Full Stack and Flatiron. (Unfortunately, Codesmith's next available cohort is too far in the future and I don't want to wait that long.) Both FS and Flatiron are approximately the same price and have similar schedules, although if I accept the FS offer, I'd have to jump right into the pre-work and catch up quickly.

Additionally, both would cost close to full price - unless I luck up on one of their seemingly limited and competitive scholarships. 

All of them teach JS and I also plan to learn Java once done with bootcamp because a lot of jobs I like place an emphasis on Java.

I don’t think I’d be ready for the more intensive 12 week programs , so I was contemplating this one. So I guess my question is , is it possible to land a job having experience in just JavaScript and python? (With putting in all the extra work it takes to land a job of course). 

I know they are two of the more popular languages, so even though I’d only have experience in two , it’d be a good two to know? (And of course I’d put in work during/afterwords to try and learn as many others as I could.) 

And by job I don’t mean some immediate 6 figure salary job. Thinking realistic , like a junior developer sort of thing and hopefully grow from there.

Also am aware I could probably get a good chunk of whatever is in the course for free/cheaper , but I find structure to help me a lot."

codingbootcamp,Stay away from Merit America,1656216252,"I graduated from the program in May from Data Analytics.
 
I feel lied to on a massive scale. 

The professional development was a joke. 

The technical skills help non existance. 
And their course is LITERALLY Coursera’s Google Data Analytics Cert, which you can access free through the American Dream project and be financially better off. 

And they literally only have like ONE company partner, who is barely hiring (despite their great need). 

They haven’t done JACK SHIT in helping find me a job, and we have to do it all ourselves!

All I have gotten out of the program was STRESS on assignments not even related to analytics &amp; tech. 

Not to mention being repeatedly being  called a sexist (which I am not, as I was born a female and lived as one for more than half my life) for asking legit questions my autistic mind can’t wrap it brain around (and never did, for any gender). So instead of explain the reason/s (like I requested), I get called a derogatory term by a member (repeatedly), and silenced by the program. (This was literally a question about the purpose of selfies)

They talk about not posting anything we wouldn’t want our employers to see... but HAVE THEY BEEN ON LINKEDIN the past few months?!? The stuff I have read is unprofessional to huge poportions. 

If an employer is turned off by something they read on my LinkedIn, then I don’t want to work for them. I post based on my morals and values. I will not be comprimising them anymore for the sake of others, nor pretending to be someone I am not. (Which I had to do in the program, a lot)

They make you sign up for like 5 job platforms with lead to an absorbent amount of spam calls that I had to take my information completely off of them!

I also feel like that fact that so many alumni have returned to MA is actually a bad sign. Makes me think they couldn’t hack it in the tech world, and have to fall bad on duping new learners. 

My mock-interview (there was 1) was an utter joke. They are conducted by volunteers who often have NO recruiting or hiring experience so IMO their feedback is pointless. My person was from India (google) and went straight to a SQL question and wanted us to write the query IN THE ZOOM CHAT after poorly explaining what the database even consisted of. 

I have even asked for the data on how MA actually helped learners to get jobs to analyze myself because I feel like they are stretching the truth and was denied.

I actually want to know how many from the first data analytics (I am the 2nd) cohorot have jobs now bc of them. 

I wish their was a way to sue to break the contract for not-fulling their duties, but it would end up costing more # than the program."

I always liked the concepts behind chemical engineering but felt like my passion wasn’t there. Instead, I always found myself diving into cryptocurrency and other tech stuff. 

I always wanted to switch into CS, but my UC university did not allow major change. Now that I have graduated I find myself lost. I do not want to continue a career that I feel I am not passionate about.

1) Does it look bad from an employers perspective that I am trying to switch from chemical engineering to software engineer? 

2) Do I have an advantage that I am an engineer graduate when applying to jobs after my Boot Camp? 

3) Which full-time Boot Camp is best for me with my previous experience as a chemical engineer graduate?

Setting aside 8:30 -1pm on Saturdays and 7-2pm CT on Sundays to build interesting projects with other people. We can start off by deliberating what we will be building, vote and decide before the weekend. We would then kick off the build session by:

1. designing the project: what components do we need to build, state management etc.
2. grouping up depending on what we want to focus on and building in small groups, ideally pairs.

One idea I have as a first build is building and deploying a platform matching a bootcamp student to a company based on culture fit. This would:

* require the user to signup using Gmail
* answer a list of multiple choice questions indicating the type of company culture they would thrive in
* based on these answers receive a list of companies most closely matched to their answers
* when a user clicks on a company they would be able to ideally see what the interview process for that company typically looks like
* we would need to scrape data from sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn &amp; Indeed to get data regarding company culture, interview process &amp; technologies preferred by said company

Working essentially 7-7 most days or later, along with complicated event based schedules makes set classes difficult, not to mention trying to be a good husband and father. 

My concern is all the reviews I’ve seen about Flatiron. I’ve scheduled a call with an advisor in a few days but I’m hesitant. I don’t want to waste 40 weeks when I may be able to walk away with better training and certifications.

codingbootcamp,Trilogy Bootcamp Review,1655680719,"I’m sure than many of you are tired of hearing about how terrible Trilogy is but I just wanted to post my experience with them so that I could warn others.

When applying for a bootcamp I applied through a reputable university not knowing that it was through Trilogy, I talked to a recruiter and was emailed an assessment, the questions were not tech related and scary easy. The following day I got a call from the recruiter and she emailed me everything I needed to sign up. In the email I noticed that instead of the University’s name it started saying Trilogy and got weirded out by it, I researched Trilogy and got mixed reviews, the main thing being that you get out what you put it. I wasn’t sure if I liked this bait and switch but of the coding boot camps I had researched this had the best hours to work around my work schedule so I decided to bite the bullet and apply.

I had previous knowledge of HTML and CSS so the first few weeks were a breeze and I was able to knock out the weekly challenges in under 30 minutes and scored 100s on the first few weeks assignments. I didn’t much of it as I had previous knowledge and we had to basically hit check boxes to finish the assignments. Once we started getting into JavaScript I noticed that my grades dropped slightly but not anything bad, I was getting 90+ on everything with feedback that praised my professional looking code and only had minor mistakes that were pointed out as to why I scored a few points under.

This trend continues through class, I scored very well despite feeling like I was struggling but my code worked at the end of the week and the praise kept coming so I was happy with it. Finally we got to the end of class, the final assignment and everything fell apart, my group hardly helped at all, we had zero communication, one person basically said they can’t pass so they were out . I worked my ass off and despite it having a working project to present when I turned in what I did I scored rather high with a note saying good effort on my part. I thought maybe they say my GitHub submissions and felt bad for me.

I’ve been out of the bootcamp for a month now and keep getting rejected while looking for jobs, I’ve shown a few people my code and I’ve come to discover that it is messy, unorganized, and barely functional, I’m basically starting from scratch now because I wasn’t doing as much well I was led to believe and it’s hurting me.

“You get out what you put in” doesn’t mean anything when you’re constantly being told that your code is professional and clean when it’s a hot mess.

I recommend that if you’re thinking about Trilogy that you run far away and never look back."

codingbootcamp,Does your bootcamp evangelize VSCode?,1655583332,"Most new developers are just excited. They want to get in there and start making stuff. They'll use whatever gets suggested. Whatever has the lowest barrier of entry. There are a bunch of text editors. I used to use TextEdit, BBEdit, Coda, Sublime, Atom, Vim, and I've tried most of the others too.

Atom came out and was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which was cool because you didn't have to know python or C or whatever custom stuff Sublime is built with. It was slower in some ways, but opened up the ecosystem to more people and there was innovation.

When VSCode came on the scene, it was free. It was basically *Atom.* But Microsoft had bought GitHub which ran Atom. I don't know the details. But whatever - - - VSCode got popular. It has a fresh look (which is really what most Jr devs care about most) - and it also had a bunch of cool plugins.

Bootcamps seem to use VSCode because it has some live server capabilities and they can get students up and running with linting and a live server and autocompletion and live shared work space - without the student having to really know what a *server* is. We can debate if that's a good way to teach - but you can see why it's so tempting. It's ""FREE!"" Does Microsoft track you? What's in that user agreement? And if you haven't tried out Github Copilot - well, you can pretty much just type pseudo code and it'll spit out a whole express rest API for you based on the code it catalogs from users and all of the open source projects. It's pretty cool. But - it's also pretty strange. If you can learn to *think* like a programmer - then you probably wont have to actually write that much *code* in the coming years. That could open up time for more *thinking* and more design - and less actual code-monkey stuff. 

But with Microsoft owning *most of the computers via their OS usage*, all of the data, Github and all of the code, NPM, VSCode, typescript, and also - LinkedIn... it sure is an interesting move to offer a ""Free"" text editor. Everyone who's new will choose it. They didn't buy Sublime Text like I did 10 years ago. Why would they pay for a text editor if they don't have to? They aren't going to read the fine print. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjY5qND8c7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjY5qND8c7U)

I just ran across this video \^ and thought it explained it well.

It's not just the text editor either. If Figma is ""free"" then why would you pay for Sketch? If Discord is free, why would you pay for Slack? Why would you pay for anything - that you didn't have to? And are you *paying* for it - in the long term - via data or the exploitation of your open-source work?

What does it mean to be a person who chooses VSCode over another paid TextEditor? What will it be like when you create your masterpiece and then a huge corporation offers a *better* version for ""free?"" Because no one can stop that from happening - except you. And the weird part is... the only way to stop them - is to pay for things from smaller companies and to learn how to design and build new companies and products instead of going to work for FAANG. When I set out to build my design/dev school, I set out to train designers. Writing code is great, but it can be normalized. It can be controlled.

What is it really costing you - to avoid *paying* for Sublime Text? What is it costing our economy and how will it change the landscape our children will live in?

What do you think?"
codingbootcamp,"Perpetual Education publically documents its accessibility-first site ""redesign""",1655574028,"**Ivy here from** [**PE**](https://perpetual.education)**.**

Have you ever wanted to learn about accessibility and how to bake it into your design process? There are a lot of good books like [Inclusive Design Patterns](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns) *by Heydon Pickering*. In that spirit, we've started a series where we'll be showing you the whole story of our ""*redesign*."" (websites really just grow and evolve)

You can follow it on YouTube here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQPcc7Ewk0&amp;list=PLeG2tdXPezVDaD-45t-oJap6ZRUfKKKYm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQPcc7Ewk0&amp;list=PLeG2tdXPezVDaD-45t-oJap6ZRUfKKKYm)

We'll be talking about all the things we teach in our course and will be talking with *real-life users*. *That's right*: Real humans who use the site with various assistive technologies.

PE is a *BootCamp-style* school in the way that it is focused and condensed, but we're a lot different. We teach a lot more than MERN CRUD/REST implementation. And so, if you're interested in the actual **design** process: *research, content strategy, information architecture, user experience, user interface, user testing, HTTP, HTML, accessibility, CSS, SVG, visual design, PHP, Git, databases, CMS, JavaScript, build tools, animation, performance.. and on and on... some Vue? some Svelte?*

We only do a few sessions a year and we've got room for our [June 27th group](https://perpetualeducation.substack.com/p/last-call-for-june-2022-session). We're always happy to chat about the industry and help you figure out what path will suit your unique goals.

I have a tiny bit of proficiency with python that is self learned, but for the most part I've got no coding experience. I've got about 4 hours daily that I can dedicate to prep before then. Is that enough time to prepare me for the tests in their application or no?

Second question: Which are the best resources to help me prepare for a coding bootcamp? CS prep on the Codesmith website  has its earliest course ending Aug 1, so that's a bit too late if I want to apply for their part time immersive. Are there (preferably free) prep resources that are as good as Codesmith's Javascript for beginners and CS Prep that I can find elsewhere? They don't have to be live classes either.

Final question: Is graduating from this bootcamp enough to land an intro level position as a software engineer? If not, what else does one need?

codingbootcamp,Keen to pair program LeetCode questions to prep for technical interviews?,1655176754,"Hi everyone, fellow bootcamper here. I don't know about the rest of you all, but I don't like 'grinding Leetcode', I prefer building things, this is what made me want to be a developer (mostly). But seeing is  inflation is a thing, I'm pretty broke and have to be realistic, I know grinding Leetcode is a must to maximize my odds of getting a good job.   


I found very early on that when I pair program with someone else to solve Leetcode challenges; I spend more time on Leetcode than I would have done alone, as a consequence getting more practice, I am forced to regularly communicate my logic which is useful in an interview, I learn new ways to solve problems in a far more practical and active way than watching a video and I explain things I understand to someone else, which cements my understanding of both the relevant algorithm and just coding in general.

This personal experience inspired my desire to build a pair programming platform where users of similar ability would get matched, receive a programming challenge, get access to a code editor and collaboratively solve the problem over an audio chat. I've actually gone as far as building out a lot of these core features and getting close to deploying an MVP.  Here's a [short video](https://www.loom.com/share/58324cf7b0044e0a9db72240511ad602) walkthrough of parts of it

Interested to start building a community around this, right now you wouldn't have full access to the platform, we would just pair program via Slack huddles/Zoom calls on a regular basis, both helping you both improve your interviewing skills and give you a first hand experience of what I am building.

If anyone's keen please let me know and I'll send you a link to join my Slack channel.

codingbootcamp,Looking for a good WordPress boot camp,1655134479,"I'm looking for a strictly WordPress or at the very least a WordPress-centric boot camp to help fill in the blanks of my current WordPress knowledge.  I'm no stranger to WordPress, I've worked in close proximity to it for a few years and have even participated in several third party backend integrations for it, but that was all mostly just PHP and very little of the WordPress API.  There's still a lot I could learn though, specifically with regard to the front end development aspect of it, site structure, custom theme and plugin development, WordPress API etc.  The kind of program that would teach me how to build a fully functional WordPress website from the ground up is the kind of thing I'm looking for.  Something project based would be best for me I think.

I've done some research, and most of the Google results for ""WordPress development boot camp"", result in the typical ""Full stack development"" boot camps, most of which have nothing to do with WordPress to begin with.  I did find one however, WPCodeCamp, and while there are some sites like Career Karma, Course Report, and Switchup that do list WPCodeCamp as a thing, none of them have any reviews posted to help verify the validity of the course.  Even their own website fails to provide any examples of student testimonials.  

Has anyone out there had any experience with WPCodeCamp?  IS it any good?  Otherwise, does anyone know of any decent WordPress specific or WordPress-centric boot camps out there that are worth the money (*and preferably under 7k USD*)?  Thanks!"

codingbootcamp,Going to create my own personal bootcamp and need some ideas!,1655075732,"Hi,

Here's my current skills:

Done:

1 Mathematics B.S. degree with some MATLAB and LaTeX exposure (LaTeK?)

1 year of integration testing in Groovy

8 months of Python 2.7 ETL scripting

2 months of learning CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/HTML5 (so very basic skills)

2 months of Power Shell for a personal project of mine, which is kinda like .NET exposure I guess

2 semesters of ANSI C in academia

1 semester of C++ in academia

In my last job, I also did have exposure to Docker, Kubernetes, AWS SQS, Azure equivalent of SQS, whatever that is, AWS S3 bucket stuff, Azure blobbey stuff, Java, Spring Boot, REST API stuff, ROS/Catkin, QGiS, Pointclouds, Terraform, Apache Airflow DAG stuff, CI/CD in Jenkins + Gitlab I guess

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have for topics in my personal ""bootcamp"": 

Scrum Mastery but really just Amateury (4 lessons so I can be self efficient in my bootcamp)

C, C++, Python and Java (a total of 12 lessons across these four languages)

Integration and Unit tests, Blackbox, Whitebox (a total of 6 lessons across all these, I don't know what the latter two are so... probably be covering that in there)

Making REST APIs and using them (2 lessons)

Making Spring boot and using them (2 lessons, honestly might be related to the above one but shrugs)

Interacting with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud in a number of different manners (a total of 6 lessons across all these, with less emphasis on Google Cloud than the other two)

Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform (a total of six lessons across these, I don't really know how they're actually related to each other so that's probably what I'd be covering in there)

Learning how to actually talk professionally on reddit (1 lesson, after I have actually started to take this bootcamp more seriously after writing this ridiculously weird post)

&amp;#x200B;

I need to add some:

\-small assignments

\-large assignments

\-a capstone project? what the hell could that be?

&amp;#x200B;

One idea I had was I would take some of the old stuff I did 11 years ago during university in those two semesters I did C work and add something to it to make it into a large assignment, like convert them all to C++, Java, Python etc.  If that doesn't sound too dumb.

codingbootcamp,Hackreactor vs Codesmith,1655052773,"I’ve been self teaching myself JavaScript for the past couple months to try to get into either Codesmith or HackReactor. For reference, I’m a complete newbie to coding. I was a bit more interested in Codesmith over the past month, and have been going through their CSX program and workshops. I find that the further I get into the CSX prep work, the difficulty level increases significantly to the point where I get to challenges that I don’t even know where or how to start. I feel like the recordings and workshop problems are a lot simpler in comparison to the problems on CSX. It worries me if I’d ever be able to keep up with Codesmith’s bootcamp even if I did get accepted. 

I started going back through HackReactors free prep course, and so far it’s been a lot easier to keep up with. I’m only halfway through though. I’m not sure if the further I get into it, the harder it will be to keep up.

For those that have gone through Codesmith:
1. Did any of you have the same feeling when you went through CSX?  
2. Did you find that the assignments at Codesmith’s bootcamp were just as difficult as CSX challenges? 

For those that have went to HackReactor:
1. Do you think the pace is appropriate even for a newbie?"
codingbootcamp,Which bootcamp?,1655051939,"I've been accepted to three online bootcamps: Full stack Academy, App Academy, and Hack Reactor (12 week program).

However, Hack Reactor seems to have better career outcomes. I've also read some things that make me worry that the quality of Full stack has gone down recently. Finally, since I've done so much work to learn JavaScript to take and pass the technical interviews for Full stack and Hack Reactor, I'm hesitant to proceed with App Academy which would start from the basics.

Any thoughts about the career services/outcomes of these three bootcamps? Any advice regarding which one I should attend or should avoid?

In total to date I have put in around 10 apps and recently been contacted to set up interviews for about 4 of those jobs and only one rejection. 

Here’s my approach
1. You don’t have to immediately get hired as a SWE 
2. A lot of what you learn are transferable skills to areas such as. Technical support engineer(someone from previous cohort got hired making 98k before comps 112k after)
Consultant usually can make around 60-80k maybe more depending on area.
Business Analyst and so many other areas that requires little to no coding. 
3 I’ve seen so many people on LinkedIn dying to get that SWE role and taking months still no job or responses even with pretty good portfolio’s and so much time spent on leetcode and hacker rank. 
4. WORK SMARTER NOT HARDER GET YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR WORK ON YOUR SKILLS, ENHANCE YOUR PORTFOLIO ,AND TRANSFER WITHIN THE COMPANY YOU WORK FOR.

Earlier this week we had a meeting with career services and they discussed resume advice, then gave us a block of time to work on our resume. 

I used some template from some website and plugged my info in. Last job, bartender for 6 years. 

For shits and giggles, I went on linked in, did a job search for ""javascript"", remote jobs, linked in easy apply. 

I applied to about 20 jobs just to kinda see how it works. I stuck to jobs that looked within my ability range. 12 polite no's, 2 invitations to complete a coding assessment, one of which is 90 minutes, and I will do Sunday on my day off from boot camp, the other is expected to take 24 to 48 hours, I don't have time for that now. 

I also had one invitation for a phone interview. I accepted. It went great, now I have a technical interview Monday for a full stack developer position with an established startup.

The phone interviewer said they hire boot camp grads, but only from a few bootcamps as ""most of them are trash"". Codesmith, hack reactor were mentioned by name as ones worthwhile. 

Basically, do your research. The bootcamp that let's anyone in who writes them a check isn't going to cut it. Do your research, there's a lot of predatory ""bootcamps"" out there."

I do not have any other college experience or degrees for background so I thought that the degree would overall look better on my resume. I do not want to go for a CS degree because it is just too heavily math based for me unfortunately. Do employers take software dev degrees seriously? And will this degree get me job ready? I am also scared that if i go for the degree I would still need to go to a bootcamp afterwards to get into specifics and that is just more time and $$ that i do not want to spend. 

As for the bootcamp i do understand that it is intense but if it can get me job ready and employers will take me seriously with just the bootcamp I would totally be more open to bootcamps!"

codingbootcamp,I finally have found it! The one area that I actually enjoy working in.,1654526258,"Over the past few years, I have worked in different fields, and tried different jobs but nowhere did I feel that I fit in. I liked a few things I did, but nothing seemed to have the pull for me, until I started coding on the side for fun. This soon turned into something much bigger and I found myself being drawn more and more into the field. Progress was slow and I didn't have the required structure and planning to learn efficiently. In my search I came across this 6- month Coding Bootcamp and everything has changed ever since.Throughout the duration of this program I did nothing but code. Each week we are given a task that at first seemed impossible but then since the entire cohort was involved, we somehow pushed ourselves to complete it. We were really hustling and learning a lot every minute. The main thing that worked for me was their curriculum, it was structured and systematic in a way that a beginner like me was able to comprehend.


I have now reached a point where I am confident enough in myself to say that this is what I wanna be doing for the rest of my life - Build products and solve problems using Tech.


My learnings: The roadmap and journey into coding is one you can take alone, but having a great bunch of people around you, who share the same passion as you, makes the entire experience all the more rewarding and fun.

codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp: General Assembly vs Code Immersive vs Fullstacks,1654447941,"  I am a vet with an IT management background from the military. I had a social science background from college which was a great experience but I had no desire for a c. Due to VA benefits, all tuition is covered which eliminates a lot of risk but only the three bootcamps discussed accept VA benefits. I've done some research on my own and will list pros and cons. Hope to get some feedback. 

1) **GA:** https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/new-york-city

Pros: Nationwide with a few overseas locations so brand recognition. It is the only school to offer in-person classes which is a big plus. and suits my learning style Because it is in-person, I get an in-person housing allowance, around 3k/month, which is more than enough (with roommates) and I'll be covered for living expenses. Class size is capped at 20.

Neutral: 16k cost which seems about normal. Three months long with about 2 weeks of pre-foundation. 60-80 hours a week which is no surprise. GA offers many courses in tech field so not sure how I feel about that.

Neg: Uses GI bill so the VA pays them all tuition upfront. Their curriculum seems messy. Starts with Fullstack curriculum with Javascript but spends time on Python and Ruby. Admissions is almost too easy. Aptitude test is like a SAT math exam. 

2) **Fullstacks** https://www.fullstackacademy.com/programs/coding-bootcamp

Pros: NYC based and popular. I know some friends who went through and successfully found jobs. Curriculum seems more structured. Fullstack Javacript only with React frameworks. Their website claims only focusing on one language will allow students to learn more rather than cram multiple languages into three months. Because it is paid through VET TEC, they receive payments of 25% when enrolled, 25% when I complete the curriculum, 50% when I am employed.

Neutral: 19k which may imply a better experience. Also three months long with about a month of pre-foundation work. 60-80 hours a week which is no surprise.

Neg: Online which is not my thing. I may learn to enjoy and adapt, but from my military background., I am so used to going to work in-person. Because it's online, I only get a housing allowance of 950 a month which is nowhere near enough for NYC. I would have to dip into savings.

3) **Code Immersives** https://www.codeimmersives.com/programs/web-development-immersive/

Pro: Short description of curriculum says its focus is Javacript. There are also classes in cloud computing resulting in a certificate with AWS Solution Architect Associate. Class size is 15-20.

Neutral: 20k which again may imply a better experience. 45 weeks which is much longer than others, which may lead to better understanding of material. 4 days a week, 6 hours a week, which they claim is a ""more measured pace so that everyone with a desire to learn has the opportunity to succeed.""

Hybrid learning: mostly online. 1 out of 5 days is in person. Housing allowance as a result is 2k/month which is doable on a strict budget.

Work laptop provided which is cool I guess.

Neg: No syllabus or curriculum found. Not much known about it, no real reputation. Uses GI bill so all tuition is paid upfront.

Summary: All three seem like decent programs. I appreciate any advice from those who have gone through one of these. Hope to get some help!"

codingbootcamp,Most affordable and substantial UX Design bootcamp?,1654345502,"I'm a NYS resident planning to move back to Brooklyn later this year, and have been wanting to use something towards my career for some time. I graduated from the Borough of Manhattan Community College with an AS in Animation and Motion Graphics. I also have a love for coding, but have realized the HUGE advantages to me starting UX Design to boost my graphic arts skills and general, web development know-how. 

One problem, though: I had to leave my job, recently, and the money I do have is being used solely for bills and general survival.

I've been looking all over the internet. Google Searches, Reddit Posts, LinkedIn, former internships and bootcamps, you name it. The only problem I'm running into is that I simply can't afford the extremely expensive cost of joining some of these bootcamps. For example, General Assembly is offering a program to me for $15k+ for their immersive bootcamp that includes resume + portfolio building. This would also include career coaching and possible placements. Sounds great in theory, but terrifying to someone who doesn't have that money to spare and knows that landing a job as a novice is pretty damn difficult (even with the organization's reputation).

So, how should I go about this? I've been looking into jobs that have paid training, as well, and apprenticeships that require no experience so that you can start from the ground up with that company. 

Would really appreciate some help on this one."

I knew going into this that it would be extremely challenging, but I also didn’t realize how little actual instruction we would get. So little of our time is spent actually learning. They seem to just throw us overboard and have us start immediately coding whatever concept we’re supposed to know. Today, we spent a total of 2 hours learning linked lists, trees, and hashes. These feel like concepts that we should spend 2 hours each on. At least. And 25% of that time was spent on re-explaining arrays as a pre-cursor to learning linked lists. I feel like the expectation is that I utilize resources outside of class to fully learn the material. Which would be fine, if the daily schedule did not go until 8 pm everyday. Again, I realize (and knew before coming into this) that such is the nature of a boot camp. I initially wanted to go the route of self-teaching, but went with a boot camp so that I’d have some sort of framework or guidance on what to learn. As well as the backing of a bootcamp in the job search process. 

Even if I decide to just power through, I’m equally, if not more, concerned with how much they talked about dismissing students from the program. They seem to be more than happy to dismiss students at any point during the program. I saw one comment on here that about 1/3 of students at Hack Reactor actually make it to the end. If that’s the case, I really cannot afford to take that gamble and risk wasting thousands upon thousands of dollars only to not make it through the program. I don’t have that kind of money or time. 

My current best alternative is to work and attend a part-time program, which also feels impossible as I’d have to dedicate around 20 hours to coding a week on top of a full-time job. I’m really not looking to self-learn either. 

I’m just feeling a little lost and was wondering if anyone had insight into Hack Reactor or advice."

""**Front End vs. Back End:**  
Front End Software Developers build the pieces of applications and websites that users see and interact with. This involves creating components that look good and provide functionality when a user interacts with them. Skills and technologies learned during the program include:

* JavaScript, Algorithms, OOP, Design Patterns, Unit Testing, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX, React, JSX, REST, NPM, AWS, and more.
* Review the Front End syllabus [HERE](https://t.sidekickopen04.com/s3t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cpmNQV-C1fV59hl3kW7_k2841CX6NGN35Qwt3vdZ-MW58Ht2k5v2JRZf197v5Y04?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3LD2m33CfBPBW4fPg3c49JH8KW4fGC1K1S1n1CW3K9y3v4hCVq3W1L6zDH24WxNxW1-X9dC3_VrSDW3T1MdZ1LnqKCW3ZSy2S4cbjTxW1G43Dz2z_V70W4f8TmK2x_FL-4PDdn1&amp;si=8000000019504273&amp;pi=f1717fa331f407f16ccbb3872d60ce86).
* Next Start Date: **July 27th**

Back End Software Developers are in charge of building applications that do the behind-the-scenes work. This typically involves receiving requests from a Front End application, processing the request, reading and writing to a database, and responding back to requests from other applications. Skills and technologies learned during the program include:

* Java 1.8, Algorithms, OOP, Design Patterns, Unit Testing, SQL, DDL, DML, Database Concepts, JDBC, Spring Boot, Spring Data, REST, JPA, JWT, AWS, and more.

Met 2 guys that landed jobs through it,1654101022,"Anyone have any idea on career accelerators and how legit they are when it comes to getting job ready? I recently came across one called The Headstarter. Was referred to it by 2 guys I know that got jobs through it, one was a comp sci major that didn’t pursue tech jobs until he took the course, the other took a bootcamp and then joined the accelerator. 

From what I learned so far, this isn’t a full-on replacement for bootcamps, but it feels like it’s to help people that were not successful in pursuing a career in the past either after college or bootcamps. Apparently they do some intense coding sessions and help build up your portfolio. 

I’m still trying to find out more about it and have reached out to them to get on a call for more info. I just think it’s amazing that we have all these ways of helping people get into tech, not only is the field getting hotter, but there are more resources than ever to get a job. I’ve been taking Leon’s 100Devs bootcamp but I will not be able to catch-up to their live sessions, so I may just go through this career accelerator route right after I’m done. 

If anyone has any experience with the headstarter or other career accelerators, any experience you can share will be immensely appreciated!"

codingbootcamp,Codesmith or DevMountain?,1654035529,"I've been combing through the endless number of bootcamps looking for one that I like and weighing cost vs benefit and I've narrowed my choice down to Codesmith and DevMountain.

I really like Codesmith's curriculum far more than DevMountain. I feel like I would learn a lot more and would have better chances of starting my tech career afterwards. The downsides are that it's twice the cost, and I'd have to wait until September to start (and I'm really looking forward to leaving my old career behind and starting a new one).

DevMountain is much more affordable and I could start in June, but I don't like that the second half of the course is Pluralsight and they're graduate hiring rates and salaries aren't nearly as good.

A little bit about me - I already know a decent amount of coding, self taught in HTML, CSS, React, Node, Typescript, etc. So I won't be going to learn how to code (I can already do that and teach myself), but instead I'll be going to learn how to collaborate with other developers on projects, to take advantage of the networking opportunities and career support, and to get something to put on my resume alongside my non-tech degrees.

So which program would you recommend? Is it worth it to wait a painfully long three months for the better program, or should I save the money, get a resume credit, and get out?"

codingbootcamp,Advice for a beginner,1654016872,"Hi! Just to preface this I know very little about web design and I’m looking for someone to point me in the right direction. I am working on a project involving electric bicycles and I would like to build a website for it. I want the website to have a retro early 2000’s feel. Here is a good example of what I mean.[Cameron’s World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/) 
Ideally the website will have a main welcome style page along with features such as a chat room, log book, the option to create a membership to the site and sign up with your email. I need to be able to upload content such as text posts, images and videos and have the option for comments available to visitors. I will eventually need to be able to sell items on the website as well.

The advice I am seeking is how does someone with no knowledge of backend web development go about making a website like this? I don’t know if any of the traditional website building platforms can achieve what I am going for. If I have to learn how to “code”(?) the website myself where is a good place to start learning, and preferably for free.

Whatever advice you can give me is much appreciated!"

I’m a US veteran living in the UK on a permanent basis. 

Looking to complete a coding boot camp to get better job prospects. I’m in a masters program now in the UK. It’s a humanities/science/artsy based course unrelated to anything tech and the job prospects particularly after COVID are just dismal. 

I have limited experience coding and I’m slowly teaching myself JavaScript now and will become more familiar with Python and R over the next 4 months for my dissertation. 

Basically my plan is to just wrap up my masters in September and began a coding bootcamp almost immediately afterwards. 

We plan to stay in the UK at least for the next few years. I’ve been looking at American based coding boot camps like Code Platoon and Fullstack Academy which I believe would be covered under the VET TEC program offered by the VA. I’ve also been looking at the UK based coding boot camps that are funded by the UK government and I believe I qualify for as I’m a permanent resident here. 

Basically does anyone have any experience with any of this stuff as a veteran and possibly going to a bootcamp like Fullstack overseas? Just trying to see if any of this is worth it. Anyone with experience with the UK government funded programs?

I’d like to get just another bachelors at least in CS but I’m just burnt out on school after a pretty intense masters degree. Would a course like Code Platoon or Fullstack even matter here in the UK as it’s not a UK based program? Or is all of this just based off a portfolio and it doesn’t matter where you learned it from. 

Thanks for any help you can provide kind of a weird question I know."

codingbootcamp,Career Switch: Time to Proficiency,1653675729,"Hey Y'all

I have a BBA and MACC in accounting. I currently work in high finance (private equity, investment banking, valuation). The pressure and time demands are considerable. I love modeling things, and build extensive Excel models for work and pleasure (fantasy sports, betting). 

I want to switch careers and learn to code. My interest is in machine learning and AI. The best path forward is probably to go part-time at my job, while taking coding classes/learning online. I am trying to figure out how long I would have to do that before I was meaningfully proficient.

How long is a reasonable expectation to learn to code? To start from zero and then understand the fundamentals of computer coding and be able to use one or two languages. I will be able to dedicate about 25 hours per week to the pursuit.

I was originally looking at the Thinkful bootcamp, as my best friend went through this program and landed a good job on the other side of it. He only had good things to say about it, and I was about 2 seconds from pulling the trigger before I stumbled upon some troubling reviews/information about the program that kind of made me a little suspicious and not as confident in that particular program, despite my friends' success in it.

I've since resigned to basically just scanning course report, looking for courses with good reviews that don't essentially feel like I'd be paying a large sum of money to watch some Udemy videos. There are some ones that have caught my eye (i.e. Nucamp, Hack Reactor, possibly Springboard or Flatiron, though I've seen some shoddy reviews for the latter 2), but there are so many courses out there, I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed with the choices and am having a hard time truly discerning which courses seem legitimately good or not, any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I know it's common on this subreddit for people to say something along the lines of ""don't waste your money on any of this, youtube videos are free,"" but it's not about the money for me. I've tried on and off for years to teach myself to code using Udemy courses or other similarly cheap or free resources, and I can do it, but when I don't have an instructor or mentor there keeping my nose to the grindstone, it's super easy for me to lose motivation and get off track. I need a bootcamp that has a structured course and instructors/mentors that will help keep me on it. I also have the money set aside specifically for this, so again, it's not about the money."

codingbootcamp,What is Amazon CloudWatch?,1653347418,"AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides you with information about the performance of your AWS resources and applications running hybrid or on premise. It also enables you to create custom metrics and monitor them on an ongoing or scheduled basis.

The Amazon CloudWatch API allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with these monitoring features and provide their users with a richer experience, while providing them the benefits offered by AWS such as cost savings and scalability. CloudWatch is a fully managed service, meaning that it does not require you to deploy or manage your own infrastructure.

### Amazon CloudWatch Categories:

CloudWatch has a large number of metrics available, which are grouped into categories such as uptime, traffic and memory. It also has custom performance metrics, which enable you to monitor your applications and the underlying infrastructure by using these new metrics instead of simple averages. You can create custom metrics, which give you finer granularity than other metrics. You can also monitor a whole application or only certain parts of it, such as a specific part of the page, a sub-section or even the entire application.

### Amazon CloudWatch Availability:

Amazon CloudWatch is available in all AWS Regions, and it’s free for all AWS customers. It is available in several languages: English, Japanese, German and Russian.

The more users, applications and resources you have on AWS, the more important it is to monitor its performance. AWS CloudWatch helps you to do this by providing several monitoring capabilities:

### CloudWatch Metrics:

Amazon CloudWatch also offers a large number of metrics from many AWS services. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2 instances, CloudWatch can provide information about your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and files, for example. CloudWatch also monitors the performance of Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) and Amazon EC2 instances.

AWS CloudWatch provides data about most AWS services that offer monitoring capabilities. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2, CloudWatch gathers data about:

Data gathered by CloudWatch is stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This means that the data is often distributed across multiple regions, the only limitation is storage capacity on all AWS Regions.

### What does AWS CloudWatch do?  

CloudWatch is a monitoring service that gives you insight into the state of your AWS resources, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon EBS volumes.

CloudWatch provides metrics to help you understand resource utilization, availability, and performance trends.  CloudWatch collects data from each of your AWS resources through event notifications.  This data can be accessed from the CloudWatch console or programmatically via an API or command-line interface (CLI).

### CloudWatch is composed of the following components: 

\* CloudWatch Events:  The way you send a notification of an event.  For example, you can select an SNS topic and schedule notifications to be sent when threshold values are met, or a resource has failed.

\* CloudWatch Logs:  Selecting log types and filtering logs by region, instance state, and customer can give you your desired level of detail.

####                                                       CLOUDWATCH EVENTS📷

### What are three things you can do in CloudWatch?  

CloudWatch is AWS’ real-time monitoring service that provides a wealth of different metrics for your EC2 instances, the health and performance of your running instances, and any changes made to the configuration.  What are three things you can do in CloudWatch?

#### 1.  Managed Metrics

One of the most important features of CloudWatch, and one of the features that I use all the time, is the ability to create real-time monitoring for your applications.  This also means you can give yourself alerts when a metric goes out of a particular range and take action.  You can set up alarms to get notified when something is wrong, or you need to restart your instance.

#### 2.  Monitoring Code

You can also monitor your applications by writing a monitoring script triggered by CloudWatch events.  This means you can monitor your application for any metric or health check or have per-application settings.

#### 3.  Real-Time Alerts

Other types of alerts are useful if your applications aren’t configured to send out notifications to some group.

### What types of monitoring can Amazon CloudWatch be used for?  

Amazon CloudWatch is an AWS service that can monitor the resources that are running in your AWS account.  With just a few minutes of configuration, you’ll be able to get data on CPU Utilization, Network In and Out traffic, disk read and write rates, HTTP Requests Queue Size, Disk Queue length etc.

Looking at the graphs and tables on Amazon CloudWatch, you can see what your resource usage is like overall or at all of your resources.

### But what if I have more than one resource in my account?  

The resource is your AWS account, and you have multiple resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, SQS queues etc.  You can set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor all of these resources simultaneously from a single dashboard.

However, we will focus on monitoring a single resource, i.e. your Amazon EC2 instance and will quickly look at the other types of resources that can be monitored later.

### How do you set up monitoring for your EC2 instance(s)?

You can start monitoring your EC2 instance(s) from the EC2 console.  Once you are signed in to the console, you will see an option for CloudWatch. Click on it to get started.

To monitor your EC2 instance(s), you must attach one or more monitoring rules to your AWS account.  A rule is a pattern that can be used by CloudWatch to filter out data from your resources based on conditions you specify.

### Is CloudWatch open source?

Amazon Web Services CloudWatch is a monitoring service for applications deployed on Amazon Web Services.

CloudWatch provides metrics and real-time analysis of your tasks, simplifying the process of running and optimizing your workloads.  The service can monitor many kinds of AWS resources, so it’s easy to integrate with other AWS services.  If you are not an Amazon customer, use one of the alternatives to CloudWatch that we’ve listed below.

CloudWatch can be used with any application running in the AWS Cloud.  The management interface is provided by the AWS Management Console, CLI or SDKs from Amazon and third-party vendors.

### CloudWatch has different service levels that you can choose from:

– Free: The service is not reserved from you and is used by anyone who wants to send metrics to the Amazon CloudWatch.  You can also use the service free with third-party vendors if they do not receive any payment from Amazon.

– Reserved: The service is reserved with your AWS account, and you can only monitor metrics sent by your AWS accounts or yourself.  You can monitor metrics sent to a CloudWatch subscribe or target resource.

### What is a CloudWatch agent?

CloudWatch agents are third-party applications that can be configured to monitor other systems and send metrics to CloudWatch.

For example, you could use a packet sniffer – a type of application that captures data packets sent over a network – on your computer as a CloudWatch agent to track your internet connection’s latency and average upload bandwidth.  The CloudWatch agent could then send the information to CloudWatch, which would make the data available for querying and graphing in CloudWatch.

For example, suppose your ISP has a customer support area that helps with billing and network issues.  You could use a packet sniffer or other software configured as a CloudWatch agent to track if there are delays when trying to reach them with support tickets."

I just made it through module 1 of the basic prep. I was able to blow through most of it as I had already completed the foundations section of The Odin Project. However, I just completed the Diagnostic Skills Check and got a bit hung up on some of the object stuff. Most of my errors were simple typos or using a for loop with ""i &lt; customerData"" rather than ""i &lt; customerData.length"". I tend to need more time to solve problems with nested objects and arrays. Most of the logic I came up with was spot on, but I ended up spending 40mins per question wondering why the heck it wouldn't work?

Questions for those of you who have completed the TAA:

1. Does the TAA ask many questions regarding nested data structures?
2. What are some general examples of questions asked? Is it as simple as the ""getLongestWord"" array questions, or do they dive deeper?
3. Does the test allow you to submit an answer, see if it didn't work, and go fix the bug, or do you submit your answer and hope that it all works perfectly the first time?

I appreciate any input! I'll be scheduling my TAA for mid-June."

I came in with absolutely 0 experience from doing labor my whole life. Although I’m on my final deferral, I’ve definitely learned a lot especially about myself and how I learn. Still in mod 1, the odds of me making to the end without any more deferrals is slim. 1 more and I’m booted from a/A..

Knowing what I know now, I will say a/A was not a waste of time. I learned how my brain works to truly grasp concepts. I’m able to break down problems, know what methods to use for those problems and apply them to those problems. 

If I started over, I’m 100% confident I would pass but sadly if you deferred out you can never apply again. This is where Code Platoon comes in. 

To sum it up Code Platoon is a nonprofit and has a 15 week Full-stack software engineer course. The boot camp is only for veterans, military personnel transitioning out, and their spouses. I’m just curious if anyone has attended and what were their end results? Has anyone gone and got into a FAANG company? Companies like Amazon and Google have donated to Code Platoon to help veterans and military personnel and that’s what made me ask. Thank you in advance!

Since I have such a diligent tutor, I'm looking for advice on how to make the best out of our weekly 1hr sessions.

I usually just show him what I've been working on and ask for thoughts or ask him to explain a concept that I'm struggling to figure out the application of.

codingbootcamp,Free coding resources vs. Boot camp,1652674955,"Hello! I recently decided to try out coding as a potential career transition and love it so far! I've been using free resources like TOP and Udemy, and recently stumbled upon the 100devs free bootcamp course on YouTube. I'm debating whether I should consider enrolling in a bootcamp course (ex. Hack React, General Assembly, etc.) after completion of these free resources, or if mastering these free-resources provides enough foundational knowledge to land a job? Does a bootcamp provide any leverage for standing out in job applications?

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp for someone with programming experience in other fields,1652555428,"Hi everyone,

I have an EE degree and professional experience with C and some side experience with Python and other scripting languages but I'm looking to transition to full stack web dev. So I have experience coding and picking up new languages on my own but I'm looking to take a bootcamp course to get the ""full picture"" in a concise manner. My concern is that most courses are sold towards ""absolute beginners"" and I'm afraid I'd be wasting time with the CS101 stuff. 

So my question is, are there more ""advanced"" bootcamps I could check out? Or alternatively, would it be feasible to write my own curriculum and patch together a number of courses on individual topics (e.g. take a React course, a Javascript course, a SQL course) and then come up with my own projects to build a portfolio. I think the second option would provide more depth on each topic but I'm afraid I wouldn't get the same breadth of knowledge because it's hard to know what you don't know! Also wondering what potential employers would prefer

codingbootcamp,Google Apprenticeship for someone with a Computer Science Bachelor?,1652445098,"Hi!

I have zero software development experience, and serious gaps in knowledge because all I've ever worked as is Tech support.

codingbootcamp,Is there a good bootcamp besides CodeSmith?,1652243090,"I've been reading this sub for several days now. Every post basically crowns codesmith the king by far, which I don't doubt. 

I've gathered that the interview process for CS is pretty rigorous, and it might take me several more months to prepare for that than another bootcamp, is it worth it? 

For reference, I know most camps focus on JS as the language, but I learned enough Java in the last few months to consistently solve leetcode easy or up to like 5 or 6 kyu on codewars questions in the optimal space/time complexity, but can't really do much beyond that. I spent the last 2 weeks learning a decent amount of JS to get myself up to level I was at in Java. 

I have a job right now I can quit and live with my parents rent free, but I'd like to actually be enrolled in a course before I do that (this hinders my ability to quickly learn the base concepts probably necessary to apply successfully for CS). Is there some magical second tier of bootcamp below CS that is worth doing that still has some coding knowledge prerequisite that I could attend instead of studying slowly for the CS entrance? Obviously I don't expect the alternatives to be as good as CS, but in my mind it might be worth it to just start a bootcamp sooner rather than later.

I see mixed reviews for basically every other bootcamp on this subreddit that isn't CS (hackreactor, full stack, app academy, etc.), so it's hard to know which one's are worth my time, if any. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: If codesmith is the S tier bootcamp, what are the A tiers, and are they still worth attending?"

My plan is to build my coding foundation by teaching myself with online resources and practice by building projects as I go along. Once I reach a mid-level amount of knowledge, I would take a bootcamp to prepare for interviews and work on my skills in a more intense environment. However, I see so many bad reviews of people dropping bc of bad instructors, lack of time, or the pace moving too fast. 

In my case, are bootcamps worth it? I know I can put in the long hours required for bootcamps, my only concern is getting ready for interviews and landing a job."

codingbootcamp,I hated my experience at thinkful,1651762486,"I finished thinkful but totally hated going through it. The only reason I went through with it is because my bf but in the end he even regretted it due to the almost 40k debt and learning experience. 

He had a great mentor where as I had a horrible mentor. I recently contacted my mentor for a reference and he said he didn’t remember me… even though he has evidence we met on zooms through a period of 11 weeks. His reference was only 8 words long, spelling two of the words wrong… he had a bachelors in English and he is a professor at a UC like wtf. He couldn’t even give me a decent reference. 

Mentor sessions with him were painful usually him just leading it to talk about the work force even when I needed help with my work. 

The instructors really went out of their way to help with the crappy curriculum they were given.

TAs were ok but many of them either gave code(code to copy and paste to pass tests) or sent us to free material like Codecademy or freecodecamp. Like I’m sorry I’m not paying hella money just to get free shit and copy/paste. 

After I finished the boot camp they pushed us to get jobs that we didn’t qualify for at all. Saying things like my 6 months at my boot camp equates to two years of work experience… I highly doubt that. The only people in my cohort who got jobs in the role we trained for either already had a bachelors in it or had prior software engineering jobs, everyone else is still stuck getting remedial jobs and it’s been a year."

codingbootcamp,Decision to make: Careerfoundry or Iron Hack? Which Bootcamp?,1651747543,"Hello everybody,

I am currently facing the question for which coding bootcamp I should choose. I plan to do the bootcamp remote.

I have been on the phone with both Iron Hack and Careerfoundry for Web Development.

Iron Hack goes for 2,5 months and Careerfoundry on the other hand goes for 5-6 months, however Careerfoundry seems to be bigger and more established and offers a job search guarantee (otherwise it's money back).

Iron Hack, however, seems to be more team-based and group learning, whereas Careerfoundry has a curriculum that you work on mostly independently and can interact with other students via chat.

Has anyone here had experience with either camp or even knows both? 

I am currently leaning towards Careerfoundry, but wanted to hear your opinions on the matter.

From what Ive seen theres 3 routes, university, boot camp or self taught.
At the moment Im deciding between university (CS) or boot camp.
Ive looked at some courses and they seem a little bit too expensive, 10k above.
Yes I understand uni is more expensive in the long run however my train of thought is this;
If I commit to boot camp, I will HAVE to pay that, regardless of if I enjoy it or not.
However with university I have the option of doing a class and testing it out and dropping before census date if I was not to enjoy it.
At the moment I am studying a bachelors of physio so I can easily switch my major.
I also understand that a degree is not needed and its based on skill and what you can do, however a degree added to that could help me.
Anyone got advice for me? Am I missing something with this boot camp or will a degree serve me better.

codingbootcamp,Some thoughts on how to select the right coding school,1651593230,"Hey everyone,

Been part of this community for the last few months and it has been really great to see people thinking about what steps they need to take for a career change. **Full transparency, i do work at a coding school** (kenzie academy) and have been for the last four years after working nine years in higher ed. 

I wanted to give some general advice about thinking through which coding school is best for you as I see a lot of people asking the same questions. In the end, no matter which school you choose, i hope the best in your outcomes! Make sure to think through the time commitment and support,  but mostly believe in yourself that you have the ability to do it. I’ve seen folks form distribution centers, retail, restaurants, bartenders, vets, pilots, drivers, etc… all now working in tech.

First, I 100% recommend sitting down and working through the vast amount of free resources out there. Take the weekend and work eight hours a day and just make sure you are passionate and enjoy doing the work. 

As you are evaluating schools there are three things you should really focus in on:

1. What does **academic** support look like during the program?  So for example, if you get stuck on a problem, how do you get help? Is there 1x1 help from a coach or teacher assistant? Is there an online wiki like stack overflow that you can search? How fast should you expect to get a response from a person?
2. What does **career** support look like during and after the program? Most schools offer resume and interview support during the program with a window of time after a person completes a program. Also examine if there is a person who is actively doing outreach to business organizations for job placement.
3. Find **alumni** and LinkedIn with jobs and **ask them** how their experience went. The majority of folks will be honest with you and are happy to help people think it through. 

There are a lot of other things you can ask as well like what does the online learning community look like? What speaker and events exist? Are there virtual career fairs, if so how often.   


Happy to honestly answer questions people might have about stepping into tech."

Now, I have a family and a full time job again so it limits my options a little moving forward.

Or should I just try to work on open source stuff and get as good as I can at leetcode and the like? Any advice on a next step would be amazing.

I did 1 class in 8th grade with web design, doing very basic coding however I am keen to properly give it a go. I talked to my co worker and he told me he thinks that its a waste of time since its too late and thinks that the people doing computer science/coding have been doing this out of high school and this was something I should’ve started a while ago (which didn’t discourage me because its a stupid statement) however I want to know to what extent is this true to, I currently have 0 knowledge whatsoever with coding, but I am keen to learn this. Is there something I should brush up on before I get into this? Maths ect.
And should I switch my major to CS for 1 semester and give it a go?

I've been teaching myself to code since Feb/March a little bit on and off. I've done the FCC HTML/CSS cert, I've done some of Codesmith's CSX and their JSB program and I've enjoyed all of that. I've also done some of 100Devs and learned from there.

I like doing JavaScript and figuring out how to solve problems, I find that really satisfying and fun. I've also gone to Codesmith's JavaScript Hard Parts workshops and have found that interesting and it makes me wanna learn more and try more.

codingbootcamp,What are the fastest ways to learn algorithms that would be relevant for coding interviews?,1651327974,"In beginner computers science lectures, such as intro to programming, data structures, and algorithms, data structures and algorithms examined in **coding interviews** are generally addressed. Although the principles offered in university courses are frequently more theoretical, students can use them to lay a foundation.

**Coding interviews**, unlike academic tests on data structures and algorithms, generally include unique questions. These questions are not inherently tough, but they do necessitate some knowledge or methods in order to arrive at the best solution. Only a few firms ask for coding problems that necessitate extensive knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

**Logicmojo**, **Leetcode,** and **HackerRank** contain a large database of questions, as well as an online judge and an active community. Many businesses provide variants of the issues listed on these websites, or they provide them verbatim. Leetcode even offers business-tagged questions, so you can see what issues a given company has faced in the past.

These problems are significantly more challenging than those seen in most coding interviews, but they can help you solidify concepts and learn new tactics by **practicing them**."
codingbootcamp,How do I prepare for product-based companies?,1651327029,"Are you planning for **product-based MNCs** such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and others?

After working as a member of the tech support team for a year, I decided to shift careers. I intended to apply for a job at a top-tier multinational corporation, but I quickly realized that I lacked confidence in DSA. As a result, I enrolled in a **Logicmojo** DSA course, which is relatively reasonable compared to other expensive courses on the market. I applied to Microsoft after completing the course, aced the interview, and am now a software developer there with a high-paying job.

You can check out these main features which had made me enroll in this course:

* **Very affordable:** I looked out courses on the internet and found that they all started at a minimum of 2 lakhs. It was too much for me as a working professional with an average salary. So I applied here, and the help I received was fantastic.
* **Career guidance:** They provided mock interviews and resume-building workshops, which helped me prepare for the job I had been looking for for a long time but lacked the necessary qualifications for.
* **High ROI:** I secured a job worth more than 12 times my investment by spending only a few thousand. As a result, Logicmojo's Return On Investment is flawless.

So despite viewing the multiple options available in the market, I chose **Logicmojo** course which helped me reach where I am today. I would recommend you to fill in an inquiry at this institution, and try out its live demo classes if you are in doubt."

* Cons: I will be learning a lot of topics by myself.  There are resources, and this is not generally hard for me, but I like some structure.  The math is going to be tough, but I will do what I have to do in the end.  I have considered a less technical degree at this school to avoid the math, but know deep down I will be doing my future-self a disservice.
   * Also, no job placement guarantee. 

Bootcamp: Cost - &lt;$20k for one with a great reputation and good job placement. 

* Pros: I will get done sooner, and also have more time to focus on technical skills such as leet-code problems, learning algorithms, or other things that will benefit my on the job opposed to learning a broad range of skills for the BSCS that may not apply.
* Cons: Costs more and I will have to take out a loan. Will not have foundational knowledge.  May hinder my cap as it may not tick the HR do-they-have-a-CS related degree box.

Opinions? Thoughts? I have also thought about applying for Oregon State, but that would take longer than both above options and cost more, just for the hope that the prestige and/or knowledge gained is worth the additional time &amp; money."

codingbootcamp,New to Coding...,1651187204,"So... I joined a bootcamp that starts in a little over a week, and I am fairly nervous as I have ZERO coding experience. 

A little bit about me... late 20s, hold a BA, and have worked in a few different areas i.e. Hotel, Healthcare, Education. 

I've been at the same job for nearly 5 years and wanted a change. I had heard about web development/coding/programming etc. online through YouTube/TikTok, and it seemed like something I would want to try. 

BUT... I did not know where to start. I could go back to school... do a bootcamp... But I am not usually the kind of person that takes risks. 

So I kinda put it off to the side... for about 6ish months. Then I ran into an old friend from high school at a funeral and of course... I treated it as a networking event. 

Turns out... she was a junior developer. I was surprised because I didn't know she knew how to code. Well, she didn't. She actually found this company that offers a full stack web development bootcamp and so long as you pass the bootcamp and are pleasant to work with, they offer you a job. 

This sounded pretty perfect because it was about as low risk as I could get.

I would still be leaving my job and be unemployed for 3 months but doing this bootcamp would basically guarantee me a job and kickstart my career. 

So last week, I spoke to my friend's recruiter, another recruiter, took a couple assessments and passed and interviewed. Luckily, I got in. 

I've been warned by literally everyone... my friend, the recruiters, the person who interviewed me, my other friend who majored in computer science... literally everyone... that the bootcamp is very difficult. Like super hard apparently. 

Is it?

I guess I will see. I got recommended some Codecademy links to learn the fundamentals of HTML and JAVA before the bootcamp starts so started that journey. So far so good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, any advice or tips before I the bootcamp? Any questions?"

codingbootcamp,I’m a bootcamp grad and I’m ready to give up on the job search… Any advice?,1651178377,"In the beginning of 2020, I decided to learn a new skill and teach myself how to code in order to transition into a new career. It took me about 7 months to learn the basics of various mark-up languages and front end frameworks (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript) before applying and being accepted to a bootcamp at the end of 2020. By Feb 2021, I was given my cohort start date and 16 rigorous weeks later, I completed the curriculum and started on my job hunt.

It has now reached the 7th month of my job search and after 250+ applications and countless multi-step interviews, I was gravely misinformed about how difficult and emotionally/mentally debilitating the process actually is. At this point, I’m wondering if the career transition is even worth it. I’m thinking I should segue into tech adjacent/non tech roles, but I’m honestly ready to give up. Any advice?"

My plan is to complete both of those courses to get some kind of foundation under me. Then jump into a bootcamp (probably 6 months from now) 

Is it likely to get a job as a junior dev without a Bachelor's? I have an Associates in Electrical Technology  for what that's worth lol and I have been attending a well known College online to get my Bachelor's in cybersecurity but was hoping to ""pause"" this and work towards the plan above.

codingbootcamp,Question about which direction I should take - bootcamp or furthering education?,1650827605,"Hi all,

I'm trying to get a job as a front-end or full-stack developer. I've been applying for jobs for the past year, and nothing has gotten past the interview phase.

I'm in the process of developing my portfolio and GitHub to add more fully fleshed-out apps. But I feel like there is something major ""missing"" that causes potential employers to lose interest.

I'm not entirely sure what that ""missing"" thing is. One employer who turned me down noted that the other candidate had a Computer Science degree, and I didn't. (I have a bachelor's but it's not in CS). I've narrowed down two choices that I think will give me a big leg up. Either go to a boot camp, or get a master's in CS. I don't think a bachelor's in CS is a viable option since that's four years of study.

The reason I'm ambivalent between the two options is because there seem to be a lot of bootcamps out there with poor job attainment rates. I talked to a rep for a bootcamp that was affiliated with my university, and they said that the bootcamp was for skills improvement, not specifically for finding a job. Sorry, I'm not dropping $10k for that.

So, my question is...what should I do? Does getting a master's in CS improve your ability to get a junior dev job? It feels like overkill, but then again, it would open some doors for me. Are there any non-flaky bootcamps?"

codingbootcamp,App Academy vs OSU Post Bacc CS,1650401682,"Hi all!

Recently got accepted to App Academy's 24 week full-time online coding bootcamp, along with Oregon State University's Post-Bacc(2nd bachelor's degree) program in CS and need some help deciding which one to attend.

A bit about me:

Late 20's, BA in Economics from UC Berkeley with 7 years experience working in the start-up/tech space in non-engineering roles such as account management and solutions/pre-sales consulting. I've worked at companies such as Workday, Stripe, and I'm currently at Slack/Salesforce. 

I grew up in the Bay Area, and have a pretty large network of referrals I can utilize. A lot of my close friends/college alumni/family members have connections to FAANG companies and are more than willing to refer me once the time comes for job apps. 

Cost really isn't really an issue for me. 

Pros of a/A: $20k cost, finish the program in 6 months, and get employed sooner(hopefully by end of the year)

Cons: Not eligible for most internships(most require you're enrolled in a degree seeking program), negative stigma perceived surrounding bootcamps 

Pros of OSU: BS in CS from a reputable university, eligibility for internships

Cons of OSU: Slightly more expensive, and 2 years to complete(1.75 years if I stack classes every quarter).

Leaning more towards a/A due to the quicker turnaround time from learning -&gt; job hunt."

codingbootcamp,I’m a 23 Year Old With NO Experience At All - What Now?,1650296363,"Hey guys, I’m a bit conflicted on the whole boot camp route for a specific reason:

I’m 23 and have no prior ”real” work experience aside from my small commercial/real estate photography business that I’ve been running for a few years. Also, I have no degree.

This concerns me because it seems like most of the boot camp grad stories I see are from people with prior work experience at companies where they already had established careers or from people that have irrelevant degrees, but have degrees nonetheless which looks good to employers.

So I’m essentially in a position where I have no prior “real” work experience or a degree to show, which I intuitively think will work against me. I’m just not fully convinced that a company would hire a 23 year old with no real prior work experience or any degree to show.

my fiance’s work has possibility of uprooting at any given time which definitely factors into my interest for the possibility of having a career that can be done remotely or is easily transferable. i also just don’t want to work a job that feels meaningless to me, i want to do something that i enjoy and feel i can grow in while i wait for school (i am graduating at 21 if matters)

i have no idea where I would even start when looking at coding bootcamps as so many would cost more than what I owe for undergrad and it just doesn’t seem worth it if i will only do it for a few years (at least for now). are cheaper programs worth it? do you have any recommendations for that? do you believe it is a waste of time to pursue for anything besides hobby work for me? also has anybody here been in similar situation and could describe their roadplan/could link a post into what their process was like?

I  realize they have a course called galvanize and I was wondering if  anyone has done this and what is there opinion on it? Would you suggest  this free course to dip your toes in and see what programming is all  about or try something different instead?"

Also, I am untrusting of the employment rate/average salary data the camps put out b/c data can easily be manipulated. 

My general impression is that there are a few good bootcamp options and as long as you get into one of those and \*work hard\* to learn and then work harder to get a job after you'll be ok.  But maybe not? 

TLDR - without naming what your choice was - how did you pick your coding bootcamp? What factors did you take into consideration?"

codingbootcamp,A year ago I graduated from a bootcamp with 21 other people. Only 6 of us are working as SWEs today.,1649784280,"I posted this on /r/cscareerquestions and it was suggested that I cross-post it here.

&gt;I wanted to make this post as kind of a counterweight to all the stories that get posted here of people attending bootcamps and then quickly making six figure salaries, because I do not think those stories really give an accurate impression to the people here who are considering going to a bootcamp. 

&gt;There's a concept in statistics called [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) where cases of failure are ignored because they're less visible than cases of success. The people who went to a bootcamp and didn't make it aren't going to come in here and talk about it, and they certainly aren't going to show up in the ""placement statistics"" that the bootcamps advertise. 

&gt;My cohort of 22 graduated a year ago from a fairly well-known bootcamp. Our program was pretty standard, three months of full-stack work focused on JavaScript and React which cost ~$15k. 

&gt;Out of those 22, 6 (including myself) are in full-time SWE roles, mostly small companies or agencies. No FAANG. 5 more are in other non-developer industry roles (recruiters, designers, support engineers etc). The other 11 are not working in the industry and most of them haven't even touched their LinkedIn profile for months. 

&gt;This amounts to a placement rate of 27% which is not great for a program that costs $15k. The official ""placement rate"" of my program according to their advertising materials is ~60% (which they reframe as ~90% by excluding people who don't participate in their career services ""to completion"" whatever that means).

&gt;I don't mean to scare people off bootcamps- they worked for me (although I already had a BA). But I do want to warn people who are thinking about a bootcamp as a *shortcut* to get into the industry without the effort or cost of a BSCS. Is it possible? Yes. Is it easy or guaranteed? No."

codingbootcamp,Which bootcamp is the best ?,1649693534,"Hi! So I have a couple of questions here. I am really interested in joining a coding bootcamp. My first question is: do I need to know what I want to do in the computer science field (EX: security analyst, software developer, front end developer, etc.) before I join a bootcamp? In other words, does a coding bootcamp prepare you for all computer science job roles or do you need to attend a bootcamp for the specific job role you want?

My other question is what is the best bootcamp to join? It’s been hurting my head looking it up. There are hundreds and thousands of boot camps out there. Preferably I want to join a bootcamp where you don’t pay tuition until you get a full-time job. What would be the best bootcamp with deferred tuition? At the same time, if there’s a better bootcamp with no deferred tuition I’ll look into joining that one too.

Please help. I am so desperate and new to this field. Also if it helps I would ideally like to complete the bootcamp in as little time as possible but willing to go up to 4-6 months

codingbootcamp,kicked out of college,1649539842,"hey guys im in a super weird predicament at the moment. Im in need of some advice, and guidance. A little background on myself. Im freshman studying a CS at a well known state school in Texas, my grades are far from perfect 2.1 GPA (barley avoiding academic probation). Anyways last night at around 2am I got caught up with the police when I was exiting my dorms parking garage. I didn't have my lights on when I pulled out, because there's lights in the garage. This caused the officer to pull me over. When I rolled my window down she immediately smelled weed resulting in a search on my car. What she found was 5g of weed and some rolling papers. As you may know Texas is SUPER strict when it comes to weed, as well as my college. The officer was super understating and let me slide on the possession charge, but she did give me a ticket for drug paraphernalia. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in the story you might find yourself asking why are you posting this in this sub? That's because at the university I attend if you have one run in with  UPD on campus that  involves drugs you're automatically expelled. This just happened last night so I haven't met with my dean but I already know my fate, its literally in the code conduct **I** signed. **Where your guys help comes into play?** I need advice on whether I should forgo my CS studies at another university or CC and just enter a bootcamp. Im not so fond of the whole college experience my time has been really shitty here. To the classes, the people, and the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a very future focused kid, Im very skeptical on forging this degree because society makes it seem like if you don't have one you're a failure. But in reality I just want to be the absolute best programmer I can be. this whole incident has me hell bent on not using weed anymore. Is my life/career over because of this one incident? I've aspired to be a software engineer now for the past 6 or so years but not that im about to be kicked out of school I don't know if I can reach that goal.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: the dilemma, kicked out of school for getting caught with weed in my car. Whats my next move, go to another university and struggle with my mental health, and courses. Or attend a bootcamp for 12 or 24 weeks"

Unfortunately, I can only use the 529 for a boot camp if it’s offered a university. Does anyone have any recommendations for coding boot camps offered at an accredited university? I saw Rice University and LSU both had programs.

I got two contradicting pieces of advice which got me really confused; one was, ""get your BS in CS, possibly masters, then complete whatever certifications"" which makes total sense, and the other ""the Bootcamp is a smarter option to avoid student debt and its so much faster"" which also kind of makes sense I also was told that FAANG+ companies tend to hire people with at least a bachelor's degree but if that is the case, why would Amazon have a 24-week program? I'm 21, this is one of my first big decisions and I want to go with the best option for me.

A friend went through a full-time bootcamp 6 years ago and went from being a restaurant server to making $120k/yr within a few years of working.  The friend suggested I might try something similar since I like to sit at my laptop, focus hard, and make numbers behave and not talk to people.

I started the 100 days of Python with Angela Yu, who is great.  I've gone through 5 modules in seven days because if I struggle with a module I go back and do it again the next day to make sure I've gotten it down.  So far I'm enjoying it, especially the parts where she tells me it's normal to get frustrated and feel like an idiot because I often get frustrated and feel like an idiot.  

&amp;#x200B;

If I go through the 100 days of Python and and take the full stack course through NuCamp, would that be enough to get me to a similar job as my friend?  He had the opportunity to go to in-person bootcamp full time.  I will have to do online part time while working to pay my mortgage.

1) First one is a 1 year program (50 weeks) that runs 4 hours per day M-F. This means I can work a job on the side to sustain myself financially. 

The tuition is fully ISA. So that means all the good and bad of ISA comes along with it. 

I start paying monthly (5%) of my salary once my earning reaches 50,000/ year pre tax. The payback %  are tiered so my % would go up(max 15%) according to the salary tier I would be in. The payment term is for 48 months.

2) Second option is basically a full-time 3 month bootcamp running 12hrs a day for what would basically be 7 days taking into account hws, projects, reviews. 

I would need to take out a loan that covers tuition+ living expenses for the ~3-4 months of bootcamp.

This is a part time bootcamp but so far I’m basically in class everyday because I’m playing catch up all the time and I do not have the time to review anything after I come home from my full time job. I consider myself a resilient person and I have worked crazy hours in the past whilst studying for my undergraduate at university, but this is a stress level I’ve not experienced yet. I really underestimated the intensity of the course and I feel that it’s best that I quit now, rather than later. 

It’s a great course but not the right timing. I think you truly need to commit to it fully rather than trying to multi- task. I think I might go the self pace route and utilise the free resources (100dayofcode) until I’m in a position where I can rejoin a full time bootcamp and focus on that solely.

I want one that will teach me about: System Architecture and design decisions/tradeoffs, patterns beyond just MVC, API creation (not just consumption), tradeoffs of database types (when to choose NoSQL), maybe even into heavier things like load balancing and caching (at least on a high level).

Obviously looking for full stack, bonus if it includes Mobile.

A strong preference for in-person (virtual) classes, not just a bunch of videos with some office hours run by uninterested former grads.

Does anyone have suggestions? HackReactor seems a bit too high level and fast, TechAcademy seems to lack instructor involvement, NuCamp actually seems decent but something about them feels amateurish?, University of Washinton's bootcamp seems structured amazingly but sadly is only Frontend.

I will try to give a list of the concepts I am NOT familiar with but know that I will need to learn at some point throughout the program so why not start now!?

\- Git / Github and   
\- Git / Bash commands / basic command line commands  
\- Javascript modules and import / export statements  
\-React / Node / Express

codingbootcamp,Looking for some answers....,1648747403,"I know this subreddit this probably flooded with these types of questions but I need some helpful advice/recommendations with choosing a boot camp. Apologies in advance for the number of questions or if I say something wrong.

For context, I did go through a few languages on Free Code Camp to see if I would enjoy doing this before committing and I wanted to see if I could become a self-taught developer that way. This route has been a challenge in terms of finding a job, so now I am looking at other alternatives. I have been watching a lot of Youtube lately and reading reviews online. I've been interested in App Academy and Devslopes as well as many others. However, there are so many boot camps and reviews and other things to consider that's it's getting to be overwhelming and I have a few questions.

Does the boot camp I choose impact how desirable I will be in the job market? Do employers have favorites/ preferences? If so what are they?  I'm assuming some boot camps have better connections to better  employers than others.

Is there more of a demand for a software developer or software engineer jobs currently? What's the expected demand for the future? Does it matter?

Is it better to be a full-stack and know all the languages or specialize in a few? 

With that being said I am looking for a boot camp I can work at part-time. I would like to start sometime this year. I am also from Michigan if that helps.  I was interested in being a full-stack developer but ultimately I don't care about what I'm learning, whether that be how to build a website, an app, or dealing with ios. My main goal is just to be desirable in the job market so I have many offers in the future. I am aware that I might have trouble finding a job and I should study something I enjoy but I just view it as a job and I want security. 

With all of this in mind can someone point me into the right directions they think would would be a good fit for me or at least something I should look into? Anything and everything is appreciated. Thank you in advance."

I'm doing an entrance assignment now and I have to say - I'm enjoying it.... I thought I would hate it -- but I don't. I even have had one or two compliments. 

But - what about the jobs ? Am I going to graduate and look like a deer in the headlights like I did 12 years ago when I graduated and I was looked upon as an idiot and told I was I knew nothing ?

Do these employers train integrate you into these jobs properly ? Do we actually work as a team or are we all politics and bullshit in the end ?

codingbootcamp,Advice: Career transition from academia in Ohio to tech/coding in Atlanta,1648404102,"I am moving to Atlanta this summer because of my partner's work and need advice about a career transition into coding (most likely via coding boot camp).

Background: Currently, I teach at two different universities in Ohio. I have a PhD in the humanities (foreign language and literature), but the job market is *extremely limited* for tenure-track positions, and there's no geographic flexibility. For the last two semesters, I have been working 80-90 hours a week. I am tired of the low pay, job insecurity, and lack of healthcare. I am also tired of the elitism in academia. I want to pivot into tech. I have several friends who have been highly successful after participating in Tech Elevator's coding boot camp. I took Tech Elevator's aptitude test last week and aced it. Afterwards I completed some small introductory lessons in Java that went well. Other than that, I do not have any coding background, but I am confident I have the skills and work ethic to succeed in coding. I really appreciate the hard skills-focused market (as opposed to Ivy-League-worship) and job availability in the field, and I love the problem-based, solution-oriented manner of work.

My question: what is the best way to pursue coding if I am planning to move to Atlanta this upcoming May/June 2022? I am fairly convinced at this point that a boot camp is the best way to go, but I am not sure about *which* boot camp. Tech Elevator is highly successful in its job placement and well-known in Ohio, but it does not have a hub in Atlanta. It does, however, have a national live remote version that I could participate in. Many of my friends have nothing but praise for Tech Elevator, and its reviews are stellar. That said, there are obviously coding boot camps that are actually based in Atlanta (like DigitalCrafts), but I don't personally know anyone who has been through them, and I don't know anyone who is in tech in Atlanta who could say whether the boot camps there are good. I would assume that at least some of them have built reputations with local companies and might more easily be able to help me get hired; these would be connections that I am assuming Tech Elevator does not have.

Any advice or direction is appreciated!"

codingbootcamp,Fullstack Academy through a university,1648388918,"Hello. Little background about me. I’ve been in retail since I was 16. I’ve done well, but it’s draining 20 years later. I’ve always loved tech and coding. Did a lot of it in the past in my high school years. Right now it’s mainly small scripts and basic stuff for my home server and various small projects. 
I’ve saved enough to be able to pay for a boot camp and comfortably live for a year at least without really digging into any savings that were not dedicated to this purpose. I want to make a career transition. 
I’ve been reading up on bootcamps and Fullstack seems like it would fit well. A semi local college offers a boot camp “powered” by Fullstack. It looks pretty much identical. Except it’s like $5,000 cheaper. Anyone have any experience with a similar program? I’d like to save the money if it’s essentially the same thing."

I only started coding about 2 months ago and have quit my job and dedicated 100% of my time to studying and learning as much as possible. After plenty of studying I passed my first technical interview and got accepted to the full time immersive this week! 

With that being said, I have about 2 whole months before my full-time immersive starts and would love to hear your thoughts and recommendations on what to study. I feel very comfortable with all the topics required to pass the technical interview (Higher Order Functions, Closure, Recursion, and some Algorithms as well). Beyond that, I don’t have very much experience with web development or anything beyond JavaScript. I know we are given plenty of pre-course material to work on before the full-time immersive begins, but I would like to ask, if you could go back and have 2 months to study full time, besides the pre course material, which would be the most beneficial to someone who wants to get the absolute most out of their time spent in the full-time immersive? Some topics I would like to be comfortable with before the start of the immersive, Which of the following would be most helpful? And if any are not as important as others please let me know! Just want to get the most out of this experience and I really appreciate all of your help!

\-HTML / CSS

\-React / Express / Node

\-MongoDB / noSQL

\-Getting comfortable with Git / Bash commands and use

codingbootcamp,Insight from coding Bootcamp to 6 figure offer,1648149699,"When I was about to join a coding BootCamp I went to this sub to ask for help. Just wanted to give my insight for those of you who are choosing, in a BootCamp, or post-graduation. TLDR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

\- I'm based in NYC and mainly looked for jobs within NY.

\- I previously worked as an account manager in an IT company (but have many classmates who had good job outcomes coming from videography, sales, marketing, etc)

\- I had minimal coding experience before BootCamp (HTML, CSS). I also did a Udemy course on JavaScript before going through the application process to make sure that this was something I'd enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Choosing a Bootcamp**

\- I shortlisted 3 bootcamps I thought were a fit for me: General Assembly, Fullstack Academy, and Lambda School.

\- I researched job outcomes and reached out to previous graduates to ask about their experience which ultimately led me to Fullstack Academy.

&amp;#x200B;

**During Bootcamp**

\- The course was intense and very fast-paced. It's important to practice coding the concepts you learn to truly understand them. I found it more effective than reading up and videos, though a mix of all is ideal. 

\- If you are involved in group projects, it's important to have significant input in the code and features, but also to understand the code that your other groupmates make. This will help you when speaking to an employer about your project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Search**

**-** Understanding Algorithms and Data Structures is essential. The majority of technical interviews will involve you solving an algorithm, so make sure you practice them using [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Algoexpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product), or whatever your preferred platform is. 

\- I would say Algoexpert is more beginner-friendly, since solutions and video explanations are available, but if you don't want to pay Leetcode is a good option. 

\- I personally used NeetCode's [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2PaQKcdwO_lwxz9bAnxXnIQayCouZP6d-ENrBz_NXc/edit#gid=0) of the 75 Essential Leetcode questions, which covers most problems and patterns you will find in technical job interviews. It includes links to all the Leetcode 75 questions, video solutions, and a section for notes. I cleared all existing notes and wrote my own once I completed a question. I found that it solidified the concept in my mind but do what works for you.

\- Apply to all and any job that isn't a ""Senior"" level job, even if it says that it requires x amount of years experience in the industry, or you don't know one of the coding languages/technologies listed. A lot of the companies will use this type of job description to let candidates *filter themselves out* thinking they aren't qualified. 

\- Don't be discouraged by rejection, even when you've made it through the interview stage. I applied to about 150 open roles and got 8 interviews. Of those 8 interviews, I only got 2 offers. At the end of the day, it only takes **ONE OFFER**. So don't be discouraged and just keep on grinding. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Outcome and Insight**

\- I received 2 offers, 1 with a large consulting company and 1 with a small startup. Both offers were in the 6 figure range (this will depend a lot on where you are based)

\- It took me 4 - 5 months to get these offers which sounds like a long time but is relatively short in the grand scheme of things. 

\- If your bootcamp offers fellowship or teaching assistant roles, I've found from previous graduates that it will boost your responses and opportunities and *could be* equivalent to an internship or experience in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

I attended Fullstack Academy because of the job outcomes of previous graduates that I found on LinkedIn. The BootCamp was intense and fast-paced so continue to practice coding as often as you can. After graduating, study algorithms and data structures (I gave a few resources in the job search section) and apply to all and any jobs that aren't senior level. Don't be discouraged by rejection and just continue grinding, it only takes one. Good luck!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this was helpful and I'd just like to thank the people on this sub who helped me throughout my process. If you have any questions just lmk!"
codingbootcamp,Want to Stand Out From Other Job Applicants? Try Contributing to Open Source.,1648144665,"As we all know, building a portfolio is instrumental in getting a job. It helps show employers that you know how to build production ready, full stack apps.

If you've got a strong portfolio and want to try something new, check out contributing to open source. In my experience it is an underrated career tool. Open Source contributions are an uncommon, yet strong signal of a high quality candidate. There are plenty of benefits:

\- learn core software job skills (how to use git, PR etiquette)

\- practice writing performant code (Most maintainers won't merge slow code)

\- build your soft skills by learning how to navigate disagreements

\- improve the libraries and tools you currently use

\- network with and learn from other developers; find a mentor

Contributing to OSS implies that you're a self-driven, ambitious person who isn't afraid to get in the weeds, collaborate with others, and make sure a solution is merged. This is essentially at the core of what employers look for in candidates.

I'm not saying run off and merge a major update into React; You can start much smaller than that. I started by writing small documentation fixes ([1](https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/pull/6456/files), [2](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/pull/347), [3](https://github.com/realpython/python-guide/pull/817)), and eventually added new functionality to libraries that I've used in some side projects ([1](https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/pull/159)).

If you don't know where to start, you can take a look at [GoodFirstIssue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/). They keep track of open source projects on github with issues that a beginner could contribute a fix for.

Hope this helps! 🤓

P.S. - The benefits transcend getting a job. I've had colleagues get promoted for contributing enhancements to internal tools. Some companies espouse a culture of [inner-sourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_source) fixes to their internal software. Contributing sets you apart, and deservedly so."
codingbootcamp,How does studying for the CPA compare to a bootcamp?,1648095662,"*This question could really apply to anyone who's studied for the CPA, BAR, or other intense professional certification exam.*

I am seriously considering a change of career since I feel that I am stock in my current line of work (Sales), I studied Electronic engineering 15 years ago, but I never really got into it for different life situations, anyway I always was interested in the coding part of my degree and I feel that now is the time.

I am 37 years old, so I don't want to spend 5 years in a University to get a new diploma, I am interested in the practical part of it, so I found out there are boot camps for coding, which is pretty much what I am looking for.

My question would be, since they are not cheap, $15K here in Canada, if it is actually worth the money, would it give me the tools and the knowledge to get a decent job in the field and the opportunity to grow in the future in this field, and if so what would you be your recommendation in schools, I've been doing my research and so far BrainStation is at the top of my list.

What I like about Coding Dojo is that I can learn up to 3 different full stacks which will help me feel a lot more confident in being exposed to multiple types of programming languages including JavaScript and Python (2 of the most common languages in demand in my area) as well as a life time support of career services. What I don't like is that there is no ISA for part time students and they don't have any previous CIRRs reports.

What I like about Hack Reactor is that they have a history of CIRR reports attesting to their transparency, a potential full scholarship, and an ISA option as a financial aide. What I don't like is that they only focus on Java Script full stack and don't have any Python courses, which is the second most in demand in my area.

I watched reviews and even had conversations with students from both via LinkedIn, but I'm just stick in a paralysis analysis.

codingbootcamp,Seeking graduate input on: Codesmith vs Sabio vs Lighthouse Labs,1647938122,"Hi all, much like many of you I am in the decision process right now, I am about 1-5 weeks from each camp's start date. I'm looking for insight into Bootcamp choices. I am looking to start ASAP as I have some flexibility to take 3-4 months off work and have no prior obligations during that time (weddings, holidays, landlord obligations, etc).   


My background: I'm 30 and changing careers, I was in program management (mental health) for 5+ years prior. I also have a ton of bartending experience as I usually do that on the weekends for extra money and to meet people. I've been a carpenter for a bit as well working in residential remodels while I was in college.  I do have a BA. I am new to coding, but have about 90 hours of experience so far in the last 3 weeks, and am enjoying myself.   


Light House Labs: I am fully accepted into LHL, but I'm put off by them being Canadian-based as they won't have the job connections an American boot camp would, and even more so after reading a fair bit of horrible reviews in regard to material and career services. I've also watched a lot of their student's final presentations and wasn't really impressed as they were fairly simple and uncreative. The positives for my situation are they are cheaper, at 10k USD, and they start sooner, and I've completed 70 hours of their prep course along with passing a technical assessment. I will admit, something doesn't feel great though about the process as it was very easy, and the only emails I've received from admin are ones that ask me to pay early. I know they are legit, I'm just not sure they are the best for me due to lesser curriculum and networking.   


Next up is Sabio. I spoke with them and they sound great, they offer a fair and straightforward ISA,( $19500 max payment), base tuition is 15k with multiple offered scholarships, and you can take a sally mae loan out to cover the expenses. I am not seeing any graduates on LinkedIn though, which is a little worrying, but the folks I have spoken to speak highly of it. I think I would be a good fit there, and their outcomes seem acceptable for the US (median pay 71k, avg job placement is 82% and they exclude silicon valley jobs as not to skew the data). They seem honest and straightforward, which I enjoy in communications with them. If anyone has any experience with them, please reach out.   


Codeworks: 20k total cost, a ton of prep work which I do not mind at all, but the biggest thing is funding and the 20k vs 15k vs 10k. I see their results though and they are quite impressive, as is their alumni network. I'm guessing after speaking with the recruiter that their tech assessment is fairly tough, but I think they also have the highest quality curriculum of the 3 schools. Their hiring median is 110-120k out of the gate, which is very impressive. I would also love to speak to any alumnus out of there.

codingbootcamp,2 months to figure if I will enjoy Comp Sci,1647671005,"I find Math pretty decent, just takes time for me more than my peers and gets just a bit boring sometimes because I can’t be so creative. (High school math)

I winged and applied to my country’s top CS + Business Program expecting I wouldn’t get in. Well, I did. Now before I accept that offer and drown myself in $30k per year in loans, I want to confirm if I will enjoy this field. 

I have quite a bit of time and I can really dedicate myself to a comp sci/data sci (I honestly don’t know the difference much) courses/ programs. Unfortunately though, money’s an issue and I can’t spend money like 4k on an in-person bootcamp. 

I want to ask for recommendations for online courses/programs that can help me gain the foundational knowledge of this field and will challenge me to help me figure out if I can survive and enjoy the work I’m doing.

Note: I have no knowledge about comp sci AT ALL. Barely remember learning about binary so I need something that can teach me from scratch // or just teach me the important higher level practical stuff that will help me figure out if this is the career for me. I was thinking of taking Harvard CS50x but I have heard it’s not good for complete beginners. 

Also, would you suggest learning about web development through a bootcamp provide me with enough info to make a decision to go into Comp Sci or no? Is Comp Sci much bigger and broader than just web?"

Already have been learning basics of html/css/js here and there for the past 2 years on my free time but want to completely start over.

Possibly go into a part-time bootcamp like Codesmith or Hack Reactor since i hear great things about them after thoroughly looking at other peoples experiences.

I want to be as prepared as possible so i can actually absorb all the content and not play catch up with beginner material.

Reason for part time its because i would like to work and i am saving up to pay it out of pocket since an ISA prohibits me from working specially since i get paid decently good from being a driver/trucker. 

Also is 8GB of ram enough or is 16 GB better for coding and multiple pages open.

I get messages from girls that are now or were going through their Grace Hopper track (women and binary folks oriented program that lets you pay after you get hired) several times a week - they are lost, disappointed in a program, some of them are still looking for a job a little under 2 years, not only getting no help from school but also FIGHTING for them to drop the tuition debt as promised (FA advertises that if you can’t find a job within a year, you’ll get your payment due dropped)

codingbootcamp,Thoughts about Codex Academy?,1647062867,"So I have been searching for as many bootcamps as possible. I am currently self-teaching but I'm not ruling out the option to enroll in a coding bootcamp. 

I accidentally stumbled on [Codex Academy](https://www.codex.academy/#/) and it looks extremely new. The only reviews that I could find on it were on [Coursereport](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/codex-academy) and there were only 8 - all positive.


It looks like the program is self paced. They offer mentorship and an optional internship once you have completed the program. The price seems relatively reasonable for a bootcamp as well. I'm a little confused on the pricing of the programs as there are 3 of them but they are building blocks of each other/seem cumulative. So I'm wondering, if you purchase the last program (full stack software engineer - $13500) then would you get the course material for the previous 2 programs as well. 

Another interesting thing I found was the ISA agreement. It states that they will only take 10% of your income for an agreed upon period of time. I could be very wrong but that actually seems feasible and reasonable when comparing it to Lambda School/Bloomtech.

This looks like it could be very promising or just another bootcamp waiting to sit back and take people's money. What are your thoughts?

As a side note, I am waiting to speak to a rep to ask some questions about the program.

Tl;Dr: Appears to be a new bootcamp. What do you think? Promising new option or another bootcamp cash grab?"
codingbootcamp,What is the top boot camp with the best environment for women?,1647062408,"I'm a woman looking to switch to coding simply because I despise my current career, in addition to the relatively low earning potential. No degree. I'm looking for a great boot camp with an environment that is at least positive for women. I have been exposed to coding before, but for all intents and purposes I am pretty much a beginner.

I got one recommendation for Ada Developers Academy, but they require that you either have experience or go through their prep course (which is apparently only offered to POC right now - technically, I am part Native American, but it's distant enough that I feel weird claiming POC to get into the program).

Someone else recommended Epicodus, but they also said half of the people dropped out before the course was over. I have negative opinions of courses where that many people drop out. Their vetting process is clearly not successful if half of the people who are allowed to join have to quit. Or they are not helping their students adequately. I want to know that if I put the time/effort in, and am not a dumbass, I will succeed.

My criteria, in short:

* Positive environment for women
* Acceptable for beginners (or at least willing to play a role in getting you up to speed)
* Willing to make sure most applicants who give a shit can pass (and learn)
* Teach useful things
* High likelihood of someone in my demographic (female, no degree, no professional coding experience) who graduates being capable of finding a job.

Please, can anyone give any recommendations on laptop/desktop specs just for an absolute beginner?

I plan to start learning to code in Python

Looking at Acer laptops, they have a discount until 21st of March here

Should I go for something very basic or is it worth straight up investing in something like this gaming laptop for more RAM etc in anticipation that I will need it to handle a heavy load in a couple of years time?

Here is the spec of what I'm looking at...

39.6 cm (15.6"") Full HD (1920 x 1080) 16:9 IPS 144 Hz

codingbootcamp,TekSystems BootCamp,1646710917,"I just want to know if anyone went through TekSystems to get into tech? 


Here’s the story: 

TLDR

I seen a post on LinkedIn advising that no experience was needed for this bootcamp through TekSystems. The bootcamp is 14 weeks long and training will be remote. Once you graduate bootcamp, you’ll be contracted through a Fortune 500 company for about 6 months then you’ll be hired on as a FTE with said company. The catch is: You must complete the bootcamp and pass with a 82% or be subject to pay back the full amount. You may need need to relocate to one of their locations in Phoenix, Boston, Minneapolis in the event employees are to  return to office and you must work with the company for 1 year. 

So, I’m like let’s do it! I really want to become a SWE. Now mind you I don’t have any code experience. I reach out to the recruiter, and I’m thinking from jump he comes off a little unprofessional but whatever. He sends me an assessment to take, and when I take the assessment for some reason it keeps timing out so in the email that was sent it says if any technical issues occur it says to close out and click the link again to finish where you left off. It would literally happened every couple minutes and when I would log back in, the timer never stopped, I would only have a few seconds left to answer or it will completely skip to the next question and the issue would happen every question. It was the most frustrating thing ever. 

So, I take screenshots and emailed it over to the recruiter. I failed the assessment which I knew because I couldn’t answer the questions. A few hours go by, I don’t receive response, so I message them on LinkedIn and I was told he’s working with  his manager about it. Another few days go by and still no response. I finally call and he didn’t even remember me, and was very unprofessional in his response when I asked for an update on the retake. He tells me my score was too low and I am not able to move forward in the process as if I never mentioned the technical errors so maybe he didn’t even get with his manager about the situation. Says he pretty much is busy and hangs up. 

I sent him another message and asked if I could speak with a manager because I feel like I wasn’t able to complete the assessment the right way. I’m sure I would have got a passing score. And, Of course no response."

codingbootcamp,My review of Springboard - Software Engineering Career Track (2022),1646626644,"**TLDR: Don't waste your time and money. Get a degree if you have the means to do so.**

I enrolled in Springboards Software Engineering Career Track in Feb 2021. I had some experience with HTML/CSS but have never done anything with a real programming language. 

First I will say that Springboard has a great student support team. They were always responsive and very helpful. The career coaches were helpful with getting my LinkedIn/resume up to par as well. However, my experience with the curriculum, mentors, and TA's was awful and absolutely not worth the cost. 

My biggest problem with this program was how the projects were laid out. They have you watch 10-20 videos, code-along, take notes, then complete a project with 50 different concepts you just learned. No quizzes, no multiple-choice tests, no questions to solidify the knowledge you just learned, just one big project that you're expected to know all the answers to. This is incredibly lazy and not at all the right way to solidify a foundation. The projects instructions were often unclear with tons of grammar mistakes. The solutions had many problems and would use syntax that was never taught to you. It's like Colt made the videos but outsourced the projects to someone else. There wasn't a single project that I could complete without having to look at the solution or ask for help, even in the prep course where they are supposed to be teaching you the absolute basics to someone who has never written a line of code before. If you are a Windows user be prepared to struggle even more, they have workaround videos but many students in the Slack have had trouble with the command line and pushing to Heroku.

In the first unit right after learning JavaScript basics, they expect you to build a full stack web application in a multi page 10000+ line codebase using only Vanilla JavaScript. Everyone in the slack channel has said this is an insane project for someone to complete after only being in the course for a few weeks. It's like the Springboard team knows it's bad, but they don't do anything about it because they got a thousand suckers signing up for the course every month with no refunds.

Colt goes super fast during his code-alongs and never explains the theory or ""why"" he's doing what he's doing. So there's a lot of pausing the video, and every time you pause there's a stupid overlay covering all the code you're trying to look at, which is infuriating. Also I'm hard of hearing and the subtitles were only there for about half of the videos. The most annoying thing for me is that he uses his fucking chickens in every single code example. It's obnoxious and it makes everything he's trying to teach you sound the same. The repetition makes it dry and you don't know the exact situations you should be using arrays, lists, dictionaries, promises, loops, functions, async/await, etc. He's trying to be funny but it had the opposite effect on me.

My experience with the mentors was absolutely awful. I knew learning how to code was going to be difficult, but the reason I paid so much money for this is so that I could accelerate and have someone get me unstuck along the way. My first mentor got fired for telling a student that it's really difficult to get a job with just a bootcamp (**spoiler alert: he's 100% right**), the second never showed up to the calls leaving me stuck for weeks, and the 3rd one didn't know Python, so he couldn't help me through my capstone project. The TA's absolutely refused to help me on my Capstone so there was literally no way out. Being stuck on this stuff by myself, in an online course, where the teacher doesn't know anything and and no classmates to ask was incredibly isolating and overall a horrible experience for me. 

I spent a year trying to complete this program that should have only taken 9 months, and I was only able to complete 50%. I struggled for an entire year. I really was putting in the hours too- I just had so many issues with getting stuck with no one to ask so I dropped out. After explaining my situation to the support team, they made an exception and I got a 50% refund. I wish I didn't waste my money though, they still got $4k from me. Just know that this is a FOR-PROFIT SCHOOL designed to generate as much money as possible, they don't actually care about your success or your career in the long term.

Even if I were to complete it after struggling so much, I'm not confident that I would have gotten a good job. They have a job guarantee, but you need to be willing to relocate, take any position offered (including internships), apply to 50+ jobs/week, and you must pass the mock interviews otherwise you will be ineligible. Read the fine print.

If you have a solid programming background and you get a really good mentor that's willing to help you more than the allotted 30 minutes a week, then this program might be alright. However if I could go back, I'd go back to college and spend that year working on a CS degree. Better late than never, I guess."
codingbootcamp,Dropping out need advice,1646624389,"Hi everyone, I've been in college for a couple years at this point and everything is kind of just all falling apart. My mental health has taken a rapid dive and it has been hard to even look at due dates or assignments without feeling extremely disappointed and suicidal. My grades have been tanking for a while and it's just a bit too much to come back from at this point in the semester. I'm really worried about having opportunities in the field after this and was hoping to get advice or reassurance from anyone that may have some helpful insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some key points I wanted to just make clear

&amp;#x200B;

1) I'm far enough behind in my classes that reaching out to my professors would be to no avail (could just be insecurity and depression talking here)

&amp;#x200B;

2) I still have around 2 years in my degree and making it past this semester seems like my total limit

&amp;#x200B;

3) Due to my grades I have stopped being able to receive financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

4) I'm paying out of pocket and with the last of the loans I was able to get for my school

&amp;#x200B;

5) I have made really big strides through a lot of open source github repos for ""coding university"" and I feel really self motivated and that I fully grasp the concepts when I can use my own analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

6)Theres a local apprenticeship that takes in individuals that are interested in tech and has a 9 week ""bootcamp"" and then they give you a reference to apply to one of the companies that works with them. Website is here, from what I hear they are a legit company.

codingbootcamp,One reason to take a 2U bootcamp,1646580896,"Hello everyone,
I'm currently enrolled in a 6 month web development course through 2U, and I've seen a lot of criticisms of the course, most of which are valid! They are by no means a perfect bootcamp that is going to get you great career connections and extremely knowledgeable support staff. And yes, you will have to do a lot of learning on your own. 

However, I'm really enjoying this course for two main reasons. The first, and most important, is that my employer is paying for it! These 2U courses are partnered with guild education, so any company that offers courses through guild as a benefit will pay for this course fully. And that makes most of the complaints about the course null, because it's not like I'm losing anything by doing this course.

 And the second reason is that it provides me with a timeline for my learning. My assignments have hard due dates and if I don't finish them I won't pass the course, and for me, that's enough motivation to stay on top of my work even though I'm working full time as well. If I did one of the free online bootcamps or courses I feel like I wouldn't have had the same motivation to get started, and as we all know, getting started is the hardest part. 

So, if you are in a similar situation to me, I hope this post helps you make the decision that is right for you! I really feel bad for the people who have to pay out of pocket for this course, but it's worth it when it's free!

If anyone has any more thoughts or thinks that I'm wrong, please tell me in the comments!"
codingbootcamp,Please help,1646572896," **Problem Statement**

#### Ninja has been given an array ‘A’ of ‘N’ integers each element of the array will be from the numbers {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} only, Ninja wants to remove a minimum number of elements from this array to make it strong.

#### An array of length ‘N’ is strong if ‘N%6’ is 0, and it is possible to split this array into the exact {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} subsequences ‘N/6’ times.

#### Your task is to help Ninja to remove a minimum number of elements from this array to make it strong.

#### Note: Empty array is also a strong array.

&amp;#x200B;

 

##### Example:

    Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 16]  Output: 6  In the given array, as the order of the elements is not according to the set we need to remove all six elements. Hence the answer will be 6.  Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24]  Output: 0  As the given array already contains the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} in the order, we do not need to remove any element from it.  Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16]  Output: 6  As the given array is incomplete, we need to remove every element of it to make it strong.  Input: 'N' = 8, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16, 20, 24]  Output: 2  In the given array, if we remove the 3rd and 5th elements the resulting array will be the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} which is a strong array. 

##### Input Format :

    The first line of input contains an integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.   For each test case, the first line will contain integer 'N', the size of the input array; The second line will contain ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of array 'A'. 

##### Output Format :

    For each test case, print the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from this array to make it strong. 

##### Note :

    You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. 

##### Constraints :

    1 &lt;= 'T' &lt;= 10 1 &lt;= 'N' &lt;= 10^4 'A[i]' will only be from the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}  Time Limit: 1 sec 

##### Sample Input 1 :

    2 8 4 8 4 12 8 16 20 24 2 4 8 

##### Sample Output 1 :

    2 2 

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :

    For the first test case, if we remove the third and fifth digit in the resulting array, we can form two subsequences {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}.  For the second test case, if we remove both elements from an array, the resulting array will be empty, and this is the only way to make it a strong array. 

##### Sample Input 2 :

    2 6 4 8 12 16 20 24 12 4 8 4 8 12 12 16 16 20 20 24 24 4 

##### Sample Output 2 :

* Losing car due to accident
* Losing insurance + antipsychotic meds + condition worsened without
* losing income due to no car to travel to work  


During the time that the BootCamp was taking place, I was just trying to get by, earn enough for rent working odd jobs, and staying sane. I couldn't put any effort into the service provided by Trilogy. I have not used any of their resources since the second week.  


I thought that I could catch up, and thought that I had to due to their contract stating that there is no ability to give refunds. Upon losing my internet at the beginning of February due to an inability to pay the bill, I reached out to Trilogy to ask what I should do. I was then informed that I could have at any point before requested a withdrawal with a refund. I was then told that it's actually too late in the program for that anymore.

None of this is advertised on their website, anywhere in the contract, nor in counsel. They blame me for not coming to them earlier. They vocalized that they expect me to take a 'Completed, but did not graduate' title from the BootCamp, and leave with no certificate. They state that there is not enough time in the program to make up the work.

codingbootcamp,Looking for advice on where to begin again,1646211518,"Hello,

I’ve been in sales for the last 6 years and it’s been a constant struggle of commission check to commission check. It’s put my family through so much stress and I’m sick of it and want a stable career.

My State, Utah, has been completely overtaken by the tech industry and anything tech/coding/cs seems to be where the kind of money and possibly working remote opportunities would be.

But idk where to start or what to do. I’ve been told to take a coding bootcamp type program and I could walk out making 75K a year. Which didn’t work out for me in the past. I took a coding bootcamp from a company called Thinkful in 2016. I was still extremely noobish and struggled to find a job. I went to a few interviews but didn’t get anywhere. I ultimately put it on hold so I could get a retail sales job to support my new baby and eventually transitioned into Real Estate sales thinking I’d do half as well as my friends who got into it were doing. Thinkful started offering the 6 months job guarantee thing like right after my class and it’s been so long it’s fuzzy, but I’m pretty sure I asked if they would honor that for me too… but they said no.

I will do anything it takes. Within 3-4 months I’d like to have any kind of CS job so I can start making money. Idc if it’s minimal. But I have to start somewhere.

What kind of code, or niche programming would you recommend somebody start that leads to a job path quickly? I heard some good things about SQL recently but tbh I don’t know anything about it.

If there’s anybody here that’s in Utah or works for a company that offers remote jobs that has advice on how I can work my way into the industry please let me know. Id even be open for a zoom call or something too.

Oh PS here’s my old GitHub: https://github.com/darkstar93

My code isn’t terrible, but it’s not great either. Obviously very beginner for the time, and it’s been years since I’ve touched it. I couldn’t get a job then, and I doubt I could get a job with these projects as a resume now… so I’d like to improve to become job ready.

Thank you!

TLDR; Wen’t to a bootcamp ton 2016 and couldn’t find a job. Got into sales out of desperation to pay bills. Want to get off commissions and find a stable coding/tech/cs job now. Looking for advice on how to be job ready ASAP to support family. I live in Utah.

codingbootcamp,Reskill Americans?,1645141843,"Has anyone here attended this and either successfully went through it or even been unsuccessful with completing it? I know the first cohort ended back in October and they plan to announce the next one soon. It looks like they've now added Web Development and UX/UI design when initially they only offered a Software Development course. I'm mainly interested due to it being completely free and not having the traditional set hours for classes  as it seems to pretty much be that you just need to get your work turned in on time. I haven't been able to find much online about it from people who have attended and the few things I did find were from early last year. I'm hoping that since it's been over for a few months I may potentially find some people who actually attended to tell what their experience is like. I remember letting them know I was interesting in the next cohort back around June of last year so I'm really hoping that I will be able to get in the upcoming one. Even if it ends up not being the greatest program or bootcamp, it'll be nice to at least experience if I can since I'm not having to commit to a few thousand or a set schedule of classes."

codingbootcamp,Questions about starting a boot camp.,1645057303,"Hi everyone! I am new to this subreddit and I am very interested in attending a boot camp for coding. However, I do have some questions ….

A little back story of myself; I am 32 years old, no college degree, working in the healthcare field as an I.T. Consultant for their EMR’s (Electronic Medical Records). I mainly work with Epic and Cerner for those who know what they are. I travel for work and I do really well for myself. But my job requires traveling, it has to be in person.

I can’t see myself doing this for the rest of my life and I’ve been looking at alternatives or an exit strategy. I’m very interested in coding. I taught myself how to do HTML, I’ve worked a bit with SQL, taught myself video editing, photo editing, music producing, and so on. I’m very good with computers and I can learn quick. 

The only problem is, I have no bachelors and I don’t know where to start.

My questions are …
1) can I attend a boot camp with no college degree?
2) can I get a job once I complete the boot camp with no degree?
3) I make six figures a year, I know I’m going to have to take a pay cut if I start this journey. I’m willing to do so in order to get stability at home and not travel for work anymore, along with future job security. However, would not having a college degree effect anything such as pay? Will it go from six figures to 60 70k a year starting?
4) what’s a trusted coding boot camp program?

codingbootcamp,Why are coding bootcamps so aggressive in their sale tactics?,1645045282,"For a long time I have entertained the idea of signing up for a coding bootcamp, but their aggressive sales tactics just make me distrust the organizations' motives... Every time I make the mistake of requesting a course outline from a bootcamp, I am inundated by daily emails and calls urging me to sign up for their classes. The most inconvenient part is that there is no way to unsubscribe. I have to actually talk to a representative and explain why I am not interested, sa I can make them stop calling... and it only works temporarily, after a few months they start messaging me again. It just feels so sketchy and pushy that I am altogether put off by the respective organizations. It happened to me with multiple bootcamps - General Assembly, Brainstation, etc. I understand they want to get me to buy in but honestly, do they really think aggressively forcing their services down my throat will make me magically interested? Does this sales tactic works with anyone? The only thing it does for me is make me question the integrity of those places."
codingbootcamp,Difference between Udemy courses vs Online Bootcamp Recorded courses vs Training Providers,1645039809,"Dear Community,

In your experience what is the difference in quality of instruction and content coverage between the three very differently priced options that I am considering to learn programming:

1) Udemy $15 courses 

2) Online training providers like [https://www.developer-bootcamp.com/web-developer.htm](https://www.developer-bootcamp.com/web-developer.htm) ($1200 per course)

3) Online bootcamp prep courses e.g. [https://www.appacademy.io/course/bootcamp-prep-online](https://www.appacademy.io/course/bootcamp-prep-online) ( $1000)

There is a considerable difference in price so I am wondering what is the additional value provided by options 2 and 3?  Is it quality of instruction or the content? 

If you have experience with any of these then please share your experiences.

codingbootcamp,Opinions on the Hack Reactor 12- vs 19-Week Immersive Program? Pros/Cons of curriculum?,1644987007,"Hi everyone, I was interested to get people's thoughts on the Hack Reactor 12-week ([fullstack javascript)](https://www.hackreactor.com/online-coding-bootcamp#Curriculum) vs 19-week ([javascript &amp; python](https://www.hackreactor.com/learn-python-learn-javascript#Curriculum)) immersive program, particularly in regard to the differences in curriculum. 

I've read through Hack Reactor's blog article on the program differences and their recommendations [here](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/comparing-hack-reactor-software-engineering-coding-bootcamps), but was curious to hear from people of why they might have gone with one one option or the other. I'd be also curious to hear from more experienced veterans of the pros/cons of possibly going with one or the other (technically speaking). 

My initial impressions aside from the obvious difference in programming languages is that the 19-week program is more recently developed vs. their tried and true /established 12-week program (I'm also assuming maybe more recent trends/marketable skills are included in this newer curriculum?). It's certainly more popular as well, from what I can tell in terms of the cohorts tending to fill more quickly.

Oddly, Hack Reactor recommends the 12-week immersive for intermediate coders, and the 19-week for complete beginners. Yet, from the curriculum description, the 19-week immersive sounds way more technical. At least, it certainly name drops way more technical jargon than the description for the 12-week program, and seems to emphasise that you learn to build distributed/scalable applications, whereas none of those are mentioned in the 12-week program. The absence of details leads me to think you don't get those skills/know-how in a 12-week program, but I'm not sure if that's true? 

Based on their blog article, I would be the target demographic for their 12-week program. I already know some javascript and python, and have done some MOOC (CS50x, about half of c0d3). However, I feel like the 19-week program sounds more appealing because of the way it's advertised/described. I'm good at self-study, but honestly don't mind more initial hand-holding and structure early on. 

Anyways, to summarise: the Hack Reactor 19-week immersive is advertised as appropriate for beginners, whereas the 12-week is advertised as appropriate for intermediates. In contrast, the technical curriculum sounds more comprehensive in the 19-week vs the 12-week (or is that just my imagination?). Thoughts on whether you're really getting more out of one program vs the other?"
codingbootcamp,Is a bootcamp still a viable way to get a good job in 2022?,1644963773,"For some brief backstory I have a Bachelors in Game Design from around ten years ago that my family pushed me into getting, I wanted to go for software engineering but that was a no-go, and my folks were paying for school so that was that. Since then I’ve had a pretty hard time finding good work; I worked at a Best Buy for three years, I did phone support for a hospital for a year, I tried to start my own PC repair business and couldn’t compete with Geek Squad, I drove for Uber for a while, and since the pandemic I’ve been out of work. Partway through the pandemic I decided to go back to school for Computer Science, and I was doing alright for a while but was forced to drop out after a hurricane tore my roof off. I did well in the programming courses, I did okay but not super well in the math courses, and I did pretty abysmally in the CompTIA cert courses. 

It’s probably worth mentioning I have a mild intellectual disability and a moderate physical disability both caused by the same medical issue. I used to be able to do physical work but can’t anymore, I’m pretty much limited to remote work these days. 

I looked into coding bootcamps around 2014 a couple years after I graduated but I didn’t really understand them. I kinda figured if everyone could learn code in six months there’d be no point in going to college, you know? A bunch of my friends did them and were placed in good jobs, but those bootcamps aren’t around anymore. I want to say Iron Foundry? Something with Iron in the name, out of Boston.  

Last I heard, Codesmith and Launch School are the two best ones, but that was a while ago. I also heard good things about Hack Reactor a while ago, not sure if they’re still considered good. Not a lot of places teach Ruby anymore which is odd because that’s what a lot of the jobs use.

Can a bootcamp still get me a job in tech, or has that ship sailed in 2022?"
codingbootcamp,Physics undergrad with questions about software engineer positions and boot camps,1644951016,"
Hi all,

Recently I finished undergrad with a physics degree. Now I’m looking for work and many software engineering positions list physics as an acceptable major. I want to apply to these but don’t believe I have enough experience; I am most familiar with python (I did my biggest project with it while in a research group) and have limited experience in C, Java, MATLAB (from course work). To prepare myself further I’m considering a boot camp or another online curriculum. 

I’ve seen c0d3 has been mentioned in a few boot camp threads and it seems enticing since it’s free but there doesn’t seems to be many reviews of it. Does anyone have experience? 

Other boot camps I’m considering are Launch School, Hack Reactor, and Codesmith. Can anyone describe their experience in these or recommend them? Any others? Are they worth the time and money? Or am I better off self studying? 

Are there any other tips or suggestion y’all have?

I am an aspiring software engineer who got into coding during the pandemic, but became too busy/tired in my personal life to maintain my study schedule. I have recently gotten back into things and I'm looking for a structured/rigorous Bootcamp that can help me pursue a career.

codingbootcamp,Flatiron vs Free bootcamps,1644796238,"Hey everyone this is my first post here, the reason I am making this post is because I am currently enrolled in the Flatiron Software Course but honestly think I messed up by doing this. I am obviously new to this industry and my friend recommended it to me as she went through the same program, but I just have not been able to make time work. 

 I am months behind due to life issues and I have tried to reach out for any support or help and haven't really heard anything back. I am just curious as to if I should try to finish basically the rest of this on a crunched time frame, or look into different bootcamps where I can basically choose what I want to learn and take the L with flatiron.

I am stuck on ruby in the FI course, and like I said have the rest to go. I am not very interested in much backend work as the experience I have had with JS / HTML /CSS has been more enjoyable. I know FCC and The Odin Project have a lot of praise behind them, but my only worry with those compared to Flatiron is finding a job after. I would also be in the hole for taking the loan out for flatiron and not finishing the curriculum.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not believe flatiron self paced is for everyone, especially if you work full time and have other duties to take care of even after you are off. Maybe I am just bitter and upset, but thats my honest opinion as of now

If anyone can give their 2 cents that would be great, I am still going to keep trying to crack down on my FI work since I am paying for it regardless. Also, if anyone is fluent in ruby and can help me on a zoom call or discord that would also be great hahaha.  


tl;dr: venting about flatiron curriculum wondering if i messed up and should just check out other free bootcamps that tailor to what I want to do"

Models I am comparing are relatively similar in price since I am buying either as refurbished (under $1100 vs $1300 for the 16"")  and have the following specs. What are your thoughts?

codingbootcamp,Worried about my gung-ho friend (General Assembly),1644431675,"I have a friend in their mid-50's, no college degree and burned out of community college. No judgement meant but they almost certainly have undiagnosed ADHD as well (I have diagnosed ADHD so I recognize a lot of the traits). My friend also has pretty much zero drive or initiative.

They are eager to soon start General Assembly, having already quit their well-paying but ungrateful job in a front office environment. It was truly soul-sucking and boring work, apparently, so I get that staying put in spite of the pay was not an option.

My friend tells me they don't have to pay for the coding boot camp at all until they get a job afterwards. Well honestly, I doubt their ability to network, I worry about the ageism of our area, and there are some other personal factors that truly cannot be helped which will likely work against my friend (or at least I fear as much).

They will be using their retirement funds to sustain themselves during the boot camp and while looking for work afterwards (rent, food, etc.). Already they are being a bit reckless with funds... They have no computer experience to speak of either, which worries me further.

Unfortunately I cannot say a word about anything to this friend. They angrily tell me people are homeless because the homeless ""don't try hard enough"" and other such nonsense about the world. Mind you, I was homeless at the time.

I am doubtful about my friend actually making it in coding, but because everyone is always thwarted from getting real with them, I feel like all I can do is watch the impending eviction from their rent-controlled place upon blowing out of General Assembly or ""just"" having a really rough time getting a job afterwards.

I hope folks here can be real with me. *Can* people with ""lots going on"" and not a lot of self discipline make it during and after coding boot camp? This friend drives me bonkers, as you can surely tell, but they deserve good things and I really hope this is not the beginning of a long and painful decline in their quality of life - to say nothing of stress levels.

What say you??"

codingbootcamp,Newbie to Bootcamp to SWE Progress.,1644343084,"Think of this as an ongoing blog that hopefully will stand as an informative anecdote for others considering the path.

I loved computers and coding as a young person, got a Vic 20 at 5 years old, commodore 128 at 8, and had desktops through 2001 or so. Taught myself basic out of the back of the Compute Gazette magazines. Learned Pascal, and later C to help code for MUDs(world of War craft for your parents day).

I got away from that stuff as my adult life started, was a multi unit manager for national restaurant chains for about a decade, then sold everything, boat a big sailboat and worked as a bartender in the keys in between cruises to the Bahamas for a few years. It worked well. Between my wife and I bartending and waiting tables during the busy season we could make in 6 months enough money for all our expenses, boat repairs/upgrades and the 6 months sailing the Bahamas. 

Sadly, now at 43, the body won't support the physical grind of that kind of work, its fun and lucrative,  but, intense on the feet, legs, back and hips. I've been battling mild to occasionally severe psiatic issues for a couple years.

And like many people, the covid mess led to some reassessment. And, traveling by boat is frankly scary as all hell. The ocean is pretty from the beach, she's quite a terrifying batch when you travel her. Plus the whole point of the boat is as a means to travel and do so on longer term a longer term basis than 2 weeks vacation a year. 

So, as most people on this forum are aware, there is an explosion and long term trend towards work from home coding jobs. I knew I enjoyed coding and was good at it from my experiences 20 years ago. 

So I started researching. Finally settled on Hack Reactor 12 week Javascript full stack immersive. Based on a combination of the material and schedule fitting my needs and the overall success level of those entering in the program. I also liked that the admissions process while not onerous, does require a lot of work, studying, practicing and proof of concept that those accepted have a decent chance of success. Also, they offer an ISA, which, while I don't *need* it allows me to hedge my bets a bit by paying half in cash and half in ISA. If it doesn't work out, as a tipped employee, im unlikely to ever meet the repayment requirements should I not get into SWE. 

So, I signed up, took a Wonderlic style aptitude test, passed, then started thier prep work. The prep work is geared to teaching you what you need to pass a technical admissions test. Roughly 30 days, average of 2 hours a day, and I passed the test first attempt. 

During this, the staff at Hack Reactor/Galvanize has been excellent. Queries via email are responded to professionally and openly, while they are all encouraging, there also doesn't seem to be a push to get people in who the program may not be right for. It seems thier business is focused on high success rates rather than just getting as many students as possible like some seem to. 

My course starts in April. The pre-workout the give before the course starts must be completed and tested prior to the start of the class, its given 4 to 6 weeks before the start date and is expected to take 150 hours to complete.  

Since I started early, I won't get my official precourse work for another few weeks. In the meantime I'm using The Odin project to learn as much html/css as possible and DOM manipulation. My goal there is to have a 3 to 5 page website that looks good and has functionality built in with javascript and some backend storage/retrieval.

Fortunately for me, having been a sailor the last 6 years, I've met a lot of people and unsurprisingly quite a few of them do this sort of work remotely, and a couple are actually in the business of hiring people to do this sort of thing remotely, so I have a bit of a head start in the networking thing. One friend wants to set me up interviews a couple weeks before the course ends. 

So, my primary goal is remote work. At 44, I don't care about a career path up to project lead or anything like that. The way we live, with even just 50 to 60k a year, we can use remote worker visas to live for a year jn 20 other countries for the next 2 decades.

I also realize that fully remote jobs are more competitive and its likely ill end up taking an on-site job for a year or so until my resume is competitive enough to get the remote work I want, or have enough portfolio I can freelance 

So far so good. I'm great with the JS problem solving aspects, those are fun. HtML and CSS are...  annoying to say the least. It looks like a structural nightmare thats grown up over the last 20 years based on a language that wasn't intended to meet the needs of the modern web, but, it is what it is and I'm slogging through it.

I'll provide updates throughout the process for me that may or may not help or encourage others"

codingbootcamp,Just graduated Hack Reactor - AMA,1643937537,"Hi everyone! I commented on one of the posts and people have asked and DM'd me for an update. I figured I'd post here so everyone can see the info. 

I joined Remote Part time program in March and completed it in this December. I have no prior coding experience, but had a good understanding on how computers work. Zero friends in tech, so no connections either. My previous work experience was in Retail and Supply Chain, so I had a lot of soft skills to begin with. 

The beginning of the program was challenging due to it's fast pace, however, given that we were working in part time cohort, it was manageable. I really liked the structure of the program and the curriculum. Staff was always very friendly and professional and I made a few friends throughout the program. I honestly miss the community a lot and here and there I pop into the zoom room of the newer cohorts to say hi and share stories. This mindset is not only mine, a lot of the people that went through the program in my cohort feel strongly the same. 

What helped me connect and bond with the community was to actively participate in class and work with fellow students on troubleshooting code together. You really get to know each individual student on a deep level and for me that was the best part of the program. Going through the struggles and growing together. 

I wish the program had more one-to-one interactions to review code and figure out best practices, but I was okay without it too. This support is there, but most of the time you have to seek it out on your own. I think that's just the way bootcamps are. 

I applied for the ISA and I'm still on the grace period which is nice. Last month of the program prepares you in heavy detail for applying for jobs. My friends from the cohort had good experience interviewing. Some got offers right away, some are still searching. But Hack Reactor name and effort we put in the program is definitely getting great attention and impression. 

I burnt out towards the end of the program and had to take time off after completing it to get back into routine and see some friends. I applied to 5 jobs, got 3 rejections (they responded, yay!) and 1 yes. which i accepted. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the program, experience, skillset learned and final outcome and would highly recommend it to anyone, however, please understand it's not a walk in the park and it requires some serious sacrifice on your end. I've missed weddings, funerals, birthdays, haven't seen family or friends that entire year, lost 3 jobs and had to job hunt while doing the program and had covid and fever on top of all that. A few times throughout the program I was on the edge of quitting due to burnout, but mentors and fellow students were beyond helpful in pushing me and helping me prioritize my health and getting back to normal. Half the people that signed up left the program early for personal reasons or because it was too difficult. You have a chance to redo it, but it's painful seeing people go."

**Hack Reactor** - New 19-week program focused on Javascript &amp; Python (full-time): 

* Overview/Curriculum: https://www.hackreactor.com/learn-python-learn-javascript#Curriculum

**Thinkful** - 5 month (full-time) program primarily focused on JavaScript:

Pros/Cons for me personally: Thinkful offers a tuition refund guarantee, while Hack Reactor does not. Hack Reactor seems to have better alumni placement at larger tech companies (Google, Airbnb, etc). Another key difference is that Hack Reactor will cover Python and Thinkful will not. 

For what it's worth, I already have spent ~6 years working at two different FAANG companies (operations roles), so I'm not quite sure the alumni thing matters as much as me gaining the necessary coding skills needed to perform the job (without taking a large risk in the process). 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

I am currently a cook in the SF Bay Area. I have been in the industry for almost 8 years and love what I do and the creativity of the industry. However, the lifestyle is not very compatible to the lifestyle I hope for now that I am thinking of having a family and how this job keeps me always from home for many hours of the day.

On top of that, I am tired of not making a very good salary, my body having to physically be in a place to work regardless of my health etc….

I have been thinking more and more of doing a boot camp because it seems like something I would enjoy. I am a fast learner and I could potentially get a side gig to save some real money to figure out if I want to stay in the restaurant industry or change my career completely.


I know this is a shot in the dark, but if anyone has any form of advice or opinions I’d love to hear.

I wanted to do on-site one because it would actually make me go there and learn/ask teachers&amp;friends and get help. Like push me to study and use the given environment. I'm not sure if I'd do as much as I'd have done at class if I were home doing zoom live study.(never tried tho)

codingbootcamp,"Putting off bootcamp - This sub has been a God send, thank you all.",1643424083,"Hi all. I have posted on here a number of times, I was intending to do an in person bootcamp and started self teaching front end stuff in October. I was on track to do a bootcamp in January, then pushed back to March. Well, now its pushed back *without* timeline haha... I can only laugh and move on because of this sub. Most helpful people on here are transparent and let others know thing going on, what to avoid, how to go about joining bootcamps. You all have been a ton of help, and really have made the process easier, as well as shared even your mistakes. I do not feel alone, even though I just self teach and have yet to code with anyone on a project. I am writing this just to share the road I have been on while trying to switch careers at 26. 

Before I expand on the road/life-happens stuff, I just want to again reiterate how *awesome* and *helpful* this sub is, that without having came across this, I am **100%** sure I would just be walking away (ADHD pi, very good at burning bridges). But because of such a positive experience and community (*usually haha*) I am more motivated now than before to be able to make a coding bootcamp a reality again. Cheers to loads more self teaching, even if it means putting off job placement opportunities a little bit!

Well my car was hit while parked by a drunk driver here in California. Long story short, I only received 25% of total damages and now its salvaged title, along with not being driven for the last 3 months. 

Well bootcamp was pushed back to fix my car, drove it 2 days and it stalls - turns out to be another 50% increase in damages all electrical related (too bad so sad already paid out, would not get more anyways). So I will be going back to waiting tables to pay off the fixes needed to get my car running. And when that happens I can pick a more concrete date to start a bootcamp again. 

I hope this is not a weird post lol, but I just have been feeling a little overwhelmed about my car, and definitely was not happy about it of course... but then coming on here, reading all that is posted, seeing the replies - it really just makes me feel better, and brings me back to the motivation to stay in it! Heres to anyone out there doubting if they can figure out a way to do a bootcamp; I know everyones day to day life is wildy different, and my current life-happens issue probably does not seem bad, but it is my issue that holds me back, but I will come above it and figure it out!"

codingbootcamp,Is a base model M1 MacBook Air a good investment for a bootcamp?,1643313995,"TD,LR above expanded bellow.

So far CodeSmith (remote) is looking like the one I’m going to go to because not only is it CIRR audited, I’ve been emailing with one of their reps who’s answered every question happily, honestly and in great detail. She’s been pointing me in directions I didn’t even think to look, their free prep courses, their free events (I’ve signed up for two) and they’ve got some really solid scholarship options to apply to. 

I’m aware of The Odin Project, Leon Noel, and I’m currently learning basics on freeCodeCamp.org. I’ve decided against TOP due to the fact they seem to only get hired if they have full on degrees in something that’s not related but still says they have a college level education. My schedule doesn’t allow me to attend Leon Noel’s live streams. I’m aware free code camp is just the basics but It’s my best option right now to prepare for a boot camp. 

So back to the question! Is a base model M1 MacBook Air a good investment for a bootcamp? Should I get the 16gb Ram instead? Would a MacBook M1 Pro be a better investment? I’m not planning on attending before late 2022/ early 2023 so I have time to save, but really don’t want to drop a fortune because I’m looking to save up for the time I’m unemployed as well."

codingbootcamp,Thinking about Nucamp - need advice,1643237872,"Hi,

I'm currently researching bootcamps and Nucamp seems to be the best for my current life situation. It's online and can be done part time at my leisure. I have a BSc in Mathematics and worked as a research assistant in mathematical modelling. Programming is not entirely new to me as I had to take courses in undergrad (beginner and intermediate Java, and other courses required MATLAB and Maple coding) and had to learn various things at my previous jobs, and I've also taught myself python as I enjoy doing machine learning projects for kaggle in my spare time.

I never really got a good job after I left school and left my research assistant position. In fact, I've been severely underemployed since then, working jobs nowhere near relevant to my education or experience. I enjoy programming and really love tinkering with code and solving problems, it was always enjoyable to me.

My biggest concern is getting a job afterwards, since this is a big commitment and it's a lot of money to me. Is the job market for this type of SWE still decent for entry level candidates? I know for a fact my city is way oversaturated for all tech roles as everyone wants to live here (Vancouver), so I would look for a remote job or simply move to another city nearby.

Any advice would be appreciated!"

Other than landing a great job, my goals are to have teachers who make learning fun, a supportive community of fellow highly motivated students with proven coding ability, and an up-to-date curriculum that also teaches data structures and algorithms.

I've heard mixed reviews about the 24-week App Academy, including on this subreddit, but I've seen mostly positive reviews about the 16-week one

Here's my analysis so far:

# App Academy

Pros: 

\- Well-established with a longstanding reputation  
\- large alumni network  
\- known to be rigorous with 80-100 hour work weeks  
\- They still offer an ISA

Cons:  
\- First three weeks will be remote  
\- they teach Ruby on Rails, is that still a thing that \*new\* web developers should be learning?

# Rithm School

Pros:  
\- small classes and intimate nature  
\- company projects which are like mini-internships  
\- teach JavaScript &amp; Python  
\- Higher-rated reviews (small sample size though, and face it: reviews are biased)  


Cons:  
\- Not as well-known, so harder to find alumni to talk to about their experience  
\- More expensive ($24000) with no ISA  
\- They teach jQuery, is that still relevant today?"

So my 2  big ugly questions are.. 1. Do bootcamps require a grade 12 or equivalent? 2. Is dropping 12-20k actually worth it??"
codingbootcamp,Questions about preparation for codesmith. Any insight greatly appreciated!,1642970255,"Some background on myself is that I have a Bachelor's in Business and am approaching this bootcamp with the intention of making a career change. Up until recently I have had next to no coding experience at all, however in the past few 2 weeks or so I have been putting in hours everyday learning everything I can, mostly through Codesmith CSX and a little time spent on phone apps such as SoloLearn. Because of what I have read about Codesmith, I am using all of this turn to focus strictly on JavaScript only, and not waste the limited time I have in learning HTML or CSS or any of the other languages. Am I correct in doing this?

My questions are regarding the best and most efficient way to prepare for the Full-time immersive which is starting March 21st 
(with the Application deadline of Feb 04,
Initial interview deadline of Feb 11, and
Technical interview deadline of Feb 19). This gives me just under 2 months time to prepare with the little experience I have, so I really want to use this time wisely.

What do you believe are my best resources to practice and study in preparation for getting accepted into, and being prepared for the full time course? I have already signed up for JS for Beginners, which the closest upcoming one begins February 12 and lasts until Feb 21st. Next I plan on taking CS Prep, however the  problem is that I can either take it Feb 14-28 (which would overlap with the JS for Beginners course although both are in Saturdays they would just end up being back to back) or Feb 28-March 14. It seems obviously to me to not overlap and take both at the same time, but with the technical interview of the nearest full time immersive being on March 5th, is it possible that I will be prepared to pass this interview before finishing CS Prep? It seems silly to me them scheduling the courses on these dates seeing as most students who plan to take the full time immersive will most likely take CS Prep to prepare for the closest upcoming course, but with the technical interview for full time being before the end of CS Prep will this be possible to do?

My last question is, besides these two courses, CSX, the slack channel, and the workshops offered (hard parts and Pair Programming), what other ways would be the best use of my time to prepare for the full time course? Should I take a specific Udemy Course on JavaScript that teaches what I won't learn in the JS for Beginners or CSX guides? Should I use Freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (300 hours so not sure I will be able to complete in full)? Should I study or complete any specific parts of the p1xt guides? There are so many different resources out there but with my limited time, I feel only the students who have had experience with the program and know the admissions process can lead me in the right direction of what I really need to know and what may be a waste of time?

I hope this isn't asking too many questions, but I have spent much time reading posts from past Codesmith grads trying to figure out how to best prepare and would rather spend my time studying! I thank anyone who has read this and is willing to offer some insight, because I'm hoping by the end of this, I will have a better life and the skills to succeed."
codingbootcamp,Is Codesmith a scam?,1642955562,"I've been looking into Codesmith for a month now and can't find that many negative things about it online. But when I talk about their reported stats with my SE friends, they are very skeptical. Here are some points I discussed with a Codesmith advisor, his replies, and why I'm still skeptical:  


1) **Employment Rate:** I asked why Codesmith only has 85-90% employment rate. 1 out of 10 grads not finding a job seems high to me when the price-tag for tuition is so high. He sort of had a bullshit answer that some people aren't confident in their coding skills and have ""imposter syndrome."" I'm nervous that since I have no experience at this point I would be one of the ""1 in 10.""

2) **Senior &amp; Mid-level Engineers:** I asked how is it possible that someone can do a bootcamp and land a job at senior-level. He said those people had previous experience going into the bootcamp. However, I'm skeptical because if people are joining this bootcamp with that much experience, how can I join the same bootcamp with zero experience? (Even if I do plan on studying and doing their CS Prep before joining). My SE friend did tell me that if Codesmith really trains students to become ""T-Shaped"" engineers in Javascript, that maybe it is possible to enter as mid-level, but she still thinks senior level is very unlikely. 

3) **Salary:** The median starting salary at Codesmith is really so much higher than all other bootcamps...it's sort of crazy? Like why would I choose Flatiron over Codesmith when the starting salary at Codesmith is so much higher? 

4) **Time if Takes to Find a Job After Graduation:** He said it takes most graduates 3-6 months to find a full-time job. I thought that this is sort of a long time (especially if you're on the 6 month end of the spectrum). Codesmith advisor said getting a SE job can be time-consuming because of the number of interviews you need to do. Idk i'm still skeptical but what I'm assuming is that even after Codesmith, you still need to study a lot for technical interviews and teach yourself more coding to actually get a good job. 

Anyway, thank you so much for reading all of this. This is a huge life decision and huge investment so I'd like to make the right decision. If anyone here can help advise me it would mean a lot to me. Thank you!"

A quick intro: I am 21F and studied social work in college and was able to land a job in the field, however, because of my extreme social anxiety I find the entire field to be very stressful and it's hard to cope with my anxiety.

I figure coding would be a good change because I hear that it doesn't require you to work with a lot of people and you can even work from home in some situations. I actually started studying computer science in college but because of my bad math skills (calculus will never make sense to me) I switched to social work as it came easier. 

If I were to try to get back into coding, would I still need to be good at math like calculus to succeed? And if not, what suggestions do you guys have for someone with no previous coding experience but wants to learn something that would give me a chance to start a new job soon?

codingbootcamp,Advice for an intermediate student (Fullstack Academy?),1642686292,"Honestly, about half of the things I read about bootcamps on Reddit seem to be negative, and I honestly agree with a lot of criticisms.

I graduated w a Bachelor of Arts in May 2021 and I want to get a full time job in the industry and move out of my parents house. I've been trying to go the self taught route and I've completed several projects but I'm not getting hired, I'm not sure I have a well rounded education, and I feel like I've hit a wall. 

I feel ashamed to admit this but I might not be self motivated enough to succeed as a self taught developer with no accountability or mentorship. I've been doing this for 2 years on and off. I have no work experience relating to coding and honestly not much work experience overall besides a customer service summer job. 

I have been accepted into Fullstack's February course and I am also considering General Assembly (I'm in NYC, though I'm still not sure if they're in person). I keep hearing people having trouble as a complete beginner in coding camps and I wonder if my intermediate-level experience means I will get more out of a bootcamp, or if I should just go back to self teaching.

Sorry to blurt out my whole life story but any advice would be great

I recently enrolled to a coding bootcamp with a scholarship. I enrolled in the bootcamp to find structure and discipline to practise coding to find my next job.

I've kind of realised that if I cant find discipline/structure on my own independently, without the use of a classroom setting/bootcamp, then how will I ever succeed as a SWE in industry?

codingbootcamp,For those who are thinking about Trilogy,1642110701,"I know there is a post about Trilogy every week here (huge red flag), but want to share something I just went through so others do not fall into the same trap I did. 

For those that do not know Trilogy Bootcamp is likely your local universities bootcamp. If you see something like ASU Full Stack Bootcamp or UCLA Coding Bootcamp that is likely Trilogy hiding under the brand of your local uni. They are generally hated on reddit and in other places. Some people have success with it, many feel like they were ripped off. 

I was trying to decide what bootcamp to go to and did an ""info session"" with an ""Admissions Counselor"" who was more of a salesman than anything. I fell into their trap and signed up. Within a few days I put $1k down and agreed to pay these people $500/mth for the next 24 months. I continued doing some research and continued finding new things about the bootcamp and noticing other red flags. The one red flag, on the pile of many, that finally pushed me over the edge was that I could not find any information about my instructor anywhere. Not on linkedin, twitter, anywhere. The thing that I had read the most was the instructor makes or breaks the class and if they break it Trilogy dgaf and your stuck with a shit education and a pile of debt. After talking with people on Reddit I discovered Resilient Coders and opted out of Trilogy. I'm out $1k, but I suppose that is better than $11k. My warnings for you all that are looking are:

1. Do your research on your own before you call for an ""information session"". These people are salesmen who are good at luring you in. Before you know it your enrolled in the program and it's too late for you to get your money back. If they are rushing you with things like ""there is only 2 seats left"" and ""I don't know when the next cohort will be"" run. 
2. If it smells like shit and looks like shit, and everyone tells you it's shit, it is probably shit. I made a lot of effort to ignore the warning signs because I wanted it to work out so bad. 
3. Ask who your instructor will be. 
4. Ask about the deposit refund policy before you put it down 
5. Ask if they report their job placement numbers (if not that is a huge red flag) 
6. Really think about what you want from a bootcamp. The point is to obtain skills, not slide your way into a job you're underqualified for. The value should always be in the education piece. If that piece is rocky or you will be relying on yourself to learn it, than why are you spending $10k-$30k? For someone to tell you what to learn? Udemy can do that for $10. 

I hope this is useful for others. Maybe me losing $1k will save a bunch of other peoples $1k which will make it at least somewhat worth it. I also want to acknowledge that I did not expect to get my deposit back, but in the case that someone does they can heed my warning."

codingbootcamp,A Deep Dive into the DevOps Roadmap,1642078570," 

https://preview.redd.it/0mqh5ffvcgb81.jpg?width=850&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61f4aa1bd58537f66c0cce1a552b7075c3d98605

The DevOps Roadmap offers an opinionated path to learning the skills needed for a career as a DevOps engineer. There's a lot of ground to cover on this path, so let's get started. 

The top section of the DevOps Roadmap is like gearing up for the trip. Here we find programming languages, operating systems, and server management. These are good skills to pick up early on. 

The insights that come from knowing how to work with software and operating systems really come in handy when you're working with applications and the servers running those applications. 

For programming, Go is the recommended language, but Python, Ruby, and Node.js are also good options. 

And Linux is the clear choice for server management. The recommended distributions are Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat. This section also emphasizes learning Bash scripting, which is a great skill to have when it comes to automating processes at the system level. 

As we ease down the road, we reach the section of the path that introduces networking protocols and the services that use them like web servers, proxies, and load balancers. With networking being such a big part of the way our world is connected, knowing HTTP, SSL, and other protocols will be useful in deploying services. 

And web servers are great services to start with. NGINX and Apache are the favorites in this category. 

Coming around the bend from services, we land into the concepts and tools that are central to practicing DevOps and site reliability. Infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and Monitoring. And of course, every modern DevOps journey includes a visit to at least one Cloud provider. Terraform is the clear leader for working with Infrastructure as code, and with containers in this category, Kubernetes and Docker are key to working with container orchestration. To be honest, CI/CD is one of the favorite places on this journey because it involves working with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. And when it comes to site reliability Monitoring is important, so we turn to tools like New Relic, Datadog, Grafana, and Prometheus. 

And no DevOps journey is complete without walking in the clouds. AWS is one of the most popular cloud services for DevOps engineers, but Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are both viable cloud platforms to learn as well. 

There's a lot of information on this roadmap and I promise you, your path will not follow directly from top to bottom. There may be sections that you skip over completely and others that you work on at the same time. For example, if you're learning about Linux Operating Systems, is it likely that you might be working with virtual servers in the cloud. These two topics appear to be far apart on the map, but in reality, they're right next to each other. Also, don't feel like you have to know everything. Learn the skills and tools you need to know and when you can, make time for the ones you're curious about. This ties into the last stop of the path, the stop that says Keep learning. It's probably the most important stop of all because honestly, with technology changing at such a fast pace, a true DevOps journey never ends."

codingbootcamp,Are the more expensive boot camps worth it? Help me change careers!,1641925365,"Hello all, I was wondering if anyone could help with a little guidance. I am in my late forties and looking to change careers. I've spent over 20 years in transportation and logistics management. Most of that time was in operational roles, but the last 3 years were spent in an IT role managing some third party software products used by the enterprise. I left the job due to the ever increasing amount of after hours on call work affecting my family life. Long term, I would like to go back to school and finish my undergrad. In the short term, I am considering a boot camp to try to switch career fields. It might be the pipe dream that we are all trying to find, but I want to change into a career where remote work and freelancing are eventual possibilities, and to are career field where there will be demand until I reach retirement age (if that's even possible nowadays).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are bootcamps an example of ""You get what you pay for""? I've looked at programs from General Assembly, Career Foundry, and NuCamp among others. There is a huge price difference between some of these camps. Is it justified? If it is, what camps would you recommend?
2. Are graduates really job ready, or will I need to create additional projects to flesh out skills first?
3. I am interested in both fullstack dev and data analytics, and my last job touched on both. Obviously, I have to pick one. I am assuming that I would need to go fullstack/front end and then teach myself the analytics piece. Would this be the easiest path? Would it be easier to do an analytics program and self learn the dev piece?

What should I expect?,1641885513,"To give a little more context, I'm currently in my Junior year of High School and my sister referred me to a bootcamp that is going to take place this summer. My coding knowledge is almost zero with my only experience being block coding in Vexcode VR. I have never been to any bootcamps, so I thought I should ask. What is a bootcamp actually like? Does it more resemble a high school classroom, where questions are more encouraged? Is it like a college course, where you are expected to research and study independently more often? Having some experience with block coding, I definitely struggled in some aspects. I always aim to understand the purpose behind actions, which drives me to ask many many questions all the time. Is a bootcamp aimed more towards people like me, or more independtly and fast learners?

TLDR : What happens in bootcamps? What is the learning experience like? Is it normal to fall behind? What to expect and any tips?"
codingbootcamp,I taught a friend how to code part time for 6 months and he was able to land a job in tech!,1641870126,"Hey Reddit!

Back in 2020 I had a lot of friends that got laid off due to covid19. Since, we're all stuck at home, I recommended that they should learn how to code so that they can get a remote job in tech that pays fairly decent for entry level roles. I found it kind of silly that even with all of the free resources out there, they still struggled to get started.

After binging a lot of animes, and getting tired of video games due to lockdown, I wanted to do something meaningful with my life. Hence, I offered to tutor my friends 1 on 1 starting in Nov 2020. It was a fun and interesting experience because I've always wanted to be a teacher, but I never had many opportunities to teach. So I took this very seriously, and I was amazed that I was able to help 1 friend starting in March 2021, land a full time gig at a fintech company after 6 months of hard work.

I was amazed because at the beginning, my friend was thinking of joining a bootcamp, which would have costed him around $10,000\~. However, I told him: ""let me try to teach you this, and let's see how far we can go."" He was hesitant at first, but I guess since the bootcamp didn't start until July 2021, he gave me a chance!

I started teaching this friend on March 2021, where we spent roughly 1-2 hours a week going over concepts, practice problems, and building out projects. One interesting trait about my friend was that he was very determined to get a job in tech, and he would be the one that asks me when we can do another lesson. This helped motivate me to continue to teach him, and before we knew it, 6 months went by and he was able to land a job in tech.

**What I learned from this experience:**

I learned that people can learn a lot and at a super fast pace, if they have a mentor to guide them through each step. I literally reviewed each piece of code he wrote to ensure that he was writing clean and concise code from day one. In addition, I made sure that he time boxed each practice problem so that way he doesn't spend more than an hour trying to figure out simple things like syntax / errors, which I think helped us move fast!

There were moments where my friend was doubtful, but as a mentor I made sure to give him pep talks to help motivate him to continue.

For example, there was this one time where he felt like giving up because he couldn't understand the concepts that I taught him. So clearly, maybe I wasn't explaining concepts clear enough, but I was super thankful for his feedback which helped me learn how to simplify concepts even further.

Obviously, learning something new like programming isn't an easy task. But, I'm grateful that he was able to stick through with the lessons and continued to want to learn more!

**A little bit about me:**

I have completed a Computer Science degree, and I am currently working full time as an iOS engineer. At first, I wasn't sure if what I taught was good enough, and I had imposter syndrome from day one. However, thanks to this friend, I guess I can confirm what I taught was useful as I was able to help him land a gig.

I have created a lot of course material, and I thought that it would be wasteful if it just collected dust in a corner. So now, I am opening the floor up and I would like to share the same resources that I taught my friend with the world :)

If you're considering a bootcamp, and would like a little taste of programming before joining one (or if you enjoy my teaching style). Feel free to join me on Youtube! Here is a link to the playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ0p1uQVHzA&amp;list=PLEcHbCIBlyJryQxxElze2C\_xMHLAJW94C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ0p1uQVHzA&amp;list=PLEcHbCIBlyJryQxxElze2C_xMHLAJW94C)

The way I structure the course is very straightforward. My goal isn't to teach every little detail of programming. Rather, I want to focus on the key stuff that I believe is important to land a job ASAP. In addition, I want to make this super accessible where people don't need to scatter the internet to piece knowledge together.

This is how the course is currently structured:

1. Learn the basics of programming in python
2. Learn web development / full stack
3. Start building projects / portfolio :)

I am currently recording the lessons, and I have completed up to lesson 15, and we are almost finished with part 1, which is the basics of programming in python :)

Anyways, if you read this far. I hope you the best of luck on your programming journey!"

codingbootcamp,What Are The Benefits of A Mock Interview?,1641416023," If you are a job seeker, job interviews can be stressful, especially if you don’t feel fully ready for the interview. A mock interview can be useful to reduce the stress of your interview process before you are in front of real companies.

  
**Benefits of A Mock Interview:**

### 1. Help candidates reduce their stress and anxiety before a real job interview.

Suppose you are:

* A junior IT job seeker,
* A newcomer to the IT field
* Feel that you are not fully confident in your interviewing skills

Practicing your interviewing skills (starting as soon as possible) is really an excellent opportunity for you to gain confidence. For those who are unsure about their foreign language speaking level, IT technical skills, or are intimidated by the (sometimes) tricky behavioral questions, mock interviews are just for you to improve these skill sets.Make sure that you practice with someone with IT experience and/or a skilled interviewer. As these types of people can give you the best feedback on whether your answers are suitable for the specific interview questions that will be asked. In this way, you are gaining real experience and learning the proper answers for future interview questions. That will help dramatically reduce the amount of stress on our back.

### 2. Help you boost your confidence.

As you practice, you will learn the answers to the most common interview questions and you will get feedback about your weaknesses and strengths. This will help you to feel comfortable when it comes time to conduct actual interviews. In addition, being confident about your skills and knowing about do’s and don’ts for the interviews will make you perform better in an actual interview..

### 3. Provide you with useful feedback in a low-stress environment.

In a real interview, you will not receive any feedback about your interviewing abilities. If you aren’t performing well, you likely will never know about it. However, a mock interview in a friendly atmosphere can support you in getting clear about your shortcomings, so that you can correct them before the real thing. So it is clear that a mock interview is an excellent opportunity to help you find your dream job much faster than you would trying to do this on your own.

### 4. Help you prepare for behavioral-based interview questions.

Many companies use “BI(Behavioral Interviewing)” questions to help them identify the proper candidates for their positions. These questions are trying to tease out which candidates have the best people skills to mesh with their company culture. These are the little details that you can practice and refine during your mock interview process.Do not hesitate to take advantage of mock interviewing opportunities even if you think your skills and experience are enough for the market. Everyone has tools that they can work on developing to make an even better impression on a potential employer.

codingbootcamp,How important would you say the local employer/alumni network for a bootcamp is during job search?,1641407876,"I'm debating between App Academy and Codesmith and i'm curious about the importance of the bootcamps network in terms of employers and alumni, and where i'd like to work. I like that App Academy seems to have a strong network in the Bay Area but I'm leaning towards Codesmith (if I can get in). However i'm not very keen in relocating to Los Angeles or New York City, where it seems like they of course have the most connections and where the vast majority of their alumni are working. Further, when doing a quick Linkedin ""alumni""  search for each of these two bootcamps, App Academy's results are much stronger and diverse. In fact, there are only 6 Codesmith alumni currently living and working in the SF Bay Area. I'm wondering if this is because many Codesmith grad's don't have Codesmith listed on their Linkedin profiles. I also know App Academy is more popular and has been around for much longer so obviously these results are very skewed for a variety of reasons, but it just intrigued me to ask this question. Do you think the city a bootcamp is in and the network they have is very important in choosing which bootcamp to attend?"

codingbootcamp,"Does anyone have experience with Fullstack Academy ""powered"" university boot camps?",1641335415,"Hi, subreddit, 

**TL;DR Would greatly appreciate any comment/discussion that may provide some guidance on FA-powered university boot camps.**

I am transitioning from my early career in the social sciences academia and museum industry - and so glad to have stumbled upon here. 

I have read of horrid Trilogy experiences mentioned across numerous posts and comments, as well as the looming criticisms against university boot camps in general as ""for-profit.""

Though I am still curious about folks' experiences in these FA ""powered"" boot camps, I doubt Trilogy runs this since this is advertised on [FAs own website](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/university-partners). As an SJSU alumni, I am heavily considering the one on the SJSU campus (small discount) and understanding that it's a 12-week program compared to the normal 17 weeks FA immersive. From my reading, the biggest difference is that the SJSU offering does not include the individual and group projects that would normally run between 12-17 weeks of the FA immersive (hence the cheaper price). 

Cheers"

After a bunch of research I had kind of decided on Codesmith, but after finding out recently that a few of my friends did App Academy and have had great success from it, my decision has became much harder. It seems like the general consensus is that the engineers coming out of Codesmith are just a bit better prepared, and also the salary outcomes and job placement are notably higher. I also see advantages to the difficult admissions process with Codesmith has, as opposed to a seemingly more relaxed admission process for App Academy. Furthermore, I like how Codesmith primarly focuses on Javascript, as opposed to Ruby on Rails with App Academy, but maybe long term this won't be a huge disadvantage? Subsequently, I think having good supportive friends who went through App Academy would be very beneficial for me if I went that route. I've read experiences from people who have both good and bad things to say about both, but was wondering if anyone here can directly comment on which would be a better choice between the two in 2022? I'm prepared to apply myself 110%, so maybe there is no wrong choice? Any insight here is greatly appreciated!"

I don't like solving coding problems.  If I could code with a friendly GUI, I'd be much happier. Thus far, coding has been a kind of tedious stepping stone to create what I like. 

Caveat: I still suck; there's no language I'm good or even passable at. However, even with HTML/CSS which i can do pretty easily, the coding is the tedious bit. There's not the feeling of satisfaction I get from solving a crossword or something.

So would a coding career basically be exactly what I dislike? Solving other people's code problems to create stuff I'm probably indifferent to?

Am I better off continuing to build my own stuff and not considering it as a possible career? (I need a career change, but don't want to chase a delusion that would actually make me unhappy)

When I looked up reviews for Trilogy (and just about every other bootcamp) they are wildly mixed from ""really good got a job before it finished"" to ""really bad its a scam"" and have seen that Trilogy is universally hated on Reddit. The main difference though between Trilogy and other mid tier boot camps that I have found is that most of their graduates that I have looked at on LinkedIn seem to be getting hired more so than those from boot camps like Nucamp. The overarching theme of these boot camps seems to be you get what you put in. As someone who knows enough to keep up and is willing to develop my skills beyond the in class projects, will Trilogy be throwing money in a fire? Does any one have any positive stories/outcomes from one of their boot camps?  Negative outcomes/experiences are welcome as well as I want to know both sides, just seems to be a disconnect between what I am seeing on Reddit vs what I am seeing on other sites."

codingbootcamp,Does it look better to potential employers to go to a university bootcamp or for-profit bootcamp?,1640896405,"I know that labels mean something in this world, but I don't know which label on a resume would have a better chance of getting hired. For example, would it mean more to have the UIC Extension (powered by Fullstack) or Northwestern Extension (Trilogy, but upon reading posts here I know not to go to this one) on your resume compared to a place like General Assembly, Fullstack (without the university label attached), or Coding Temple? 

However, for UIC, NW and a few other ""university-sponsored"" camps I've looked at, their programs seems less rigorous (10am-2pm five days a week instead of 9am-5pm that I've seen for other full-time 12 week programs). It also seems that General Assembly is the only group potentially offering in-person classes next year, and if I did a camp I'd 100% prefer to go in-person. But I think I'm leaning towards GA in general because I've attended so many of their free virtual events and have am familiar with them. 

I already am bad at decision making and the amount of options and financial overhead that comes with ""breaking into tech"" through a camp definitely makes it worse. Thank you in advance for your opinions and advice!"

**Freemote Reviews**  Freelancing Learning Curve

Of our 37 respondents, the larger part said that being a specialist took their understanding to a more critical level than being an advisor due to the openness of mentorship. The benefits of starting as a specialist are unending as you get receptiveness to perceiving coding standards, working with a gathering of designers, and a faster assumption to retain data as you will be lowered in the gig morning, noon and night.  **Freemote Reviews** 

[https://www.freemote.com/](https://www.freemote.com/) 

As a specialist, the outing is more vicious where reliable experimentation and creative mind is frequently fundamental. While rethinking can confine the receptiveness to new learning openings, this can be stimulating for the people who prosper under self-composed guidance. With more unmistakable data on the business and a sound pool of individual references, you may participate in the chance re-appropriating includes."

Is it absurd to get a cs degree &amp; go to a bootcamp?

Have y’all gone to a web / analytics bootcamp with a cs or tech background? If so, what did y’all think? Is it worth it?

For me, it’s this or grad school. And idk but in so far for undergrad it’s been mostly theory. Not too difficult just a lot of self teaching + theory.

codingbootcamp,Why is everyone obsessed with 3-4 month bootcamps?,1639759048,"For any other potential job, quitting your current job and studying from “full time” to 90 hours a week for a few months expecting to get a full time job that pays all the bills sounds insane. I’ve worked 90 hour weeks bartending making a butt load of money but by the end I felt like a zombie. When I was in college full time I never would have studied for 90 hours a week. Not because I lacked the discipline, but because I knew my puny human brain could only take so much before studying more was useless. Why is that normalized in bootcamps? 
I get that the “best” or “most efficient” way to learn something like a new speaking language is to move to where only that language is spoken and immerse yourself in it but does it really work that way for programming too?
Why aren’t people more interested in the part time bootcamps that expect you to put in 18-22 hours a week for 9-12 months? It would seem like that would give you much more time to let the lessons sink in and for you to apply them in your personal projects. And you can keep your job and current income levels while working toward something better. Does that sound crazy?

I’m thinking it is one or two major reasons but feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
1. Coding bootcamps have figured out the fastest and most efficient way to get money out of the most amount of people while being able to say they exposed the students to all of the material is to have cohorts every 3-4 months. Capitalism at its finest. They have a marketing budget to spend on promoting these short term full-time programs so that’s what everyone hears about.
2. People are desperate and impatient to change jobs into “tech” and bootcamps are a path of least resistance compared to getting a 4 year CS degree. It is faster and “harder” and the students are assuming that they will retain more than they forget by the end.

A little background on me:
29 M, US based, Bachelors in psychology, lifetime server/bartender, started teaching myself coding October 2021 using freecodecamp, Codecademy, and The Odin Project (currently 50% through the foundations), Angela Yu’s 100 days of code, and I have Colt Steele’s The Web Developers Bootcamp 2022 as well as Automate the Boring Stuff that I haven’t started yet. I’m also set to begin freecodecamp’s free online bootcamp starting January. I learn best in a structure outside of myself so I will be taking some type of bootcamp once I feel I’m hitting a plateau of what I can teach myself using these resources. I’m thinking Codesmith but we’ll see. I would appreciate any insight you all can provide, but I prefer to learn from the personal experience of others rather than “I read on career karma bootcamp X is good”. I’ve already read on career karma that every bootcamp is the best there ever was lol.

TLDR: Why is quitting your job and working on a bootcamp for 60-90 hours for 3-4 months somehow better than doing a part-time 18-22 hour bootcamp?"

I am a homemaker and am seeking a new career. I realized that I don't like teaching after spending 3 years on my master's program in education. I was depressed for awhile because I blamed myself on choosing a wrong career after spending so much $$ and time. My therapist helped me to get out of the situation and I started to learn coding by myself in the last few months and I found I like it. Now I am thinking to find a bootcamp to learn deeper and change my career. 

I am living on the west coast and am available on M-F from 9am -3:30pm. Please suggest me some bootcamps which would fit my schedule and a place I can focus on learning Java/Javascript. I want to find a place where I can really learn sufficient skills to start a new career. Please, no advertisements. I am hoping to hear about people's personal experiences. Thank you very much!"

The bootcamp encourages people to begin applying for jobs right away but I feel like I am nowhere near ready and will likely do awful in any interviews that come my way.

I would like to get a good plan in place for when I finish and try to focus my time well on reviewing the materials I was introduced to throughout the program.

codingbootcamp,Join Bootcamp or Finish CS Degree?,1639420704,"I'm a Junior in CS. I studied another major before CS and spent 3 years at it. Switched to CS Fall 2020 and took 18-22 credits a semester since. I have 12 classes left. I anticipate it will take me about 1.5 years to finish. However, I want to start working as a software engineer, badly. I have been studying for about 5 years now in total and I am sick of it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not sick of learning new things, I just want to start working! I love studying, and learning new things, but If I can join a Bootcamp for 12-16 weeks and have a job a few months after that would be much more desirable. I know people who do not get a job for a year (or longer) after completing a CS degree as it didn't prepare them for SWE jobs anyways. I don't want to be in that boat. My long-term goal is to have an enjoyable career in tech as a software engineer.

Am I being shortsighted? Or should I join a Bootcamp and put a pause on my CS degree?"
codingbootcamp,Tech Elevator Financing,1639288060,"Recently got accepted to Tech Elevator in Cincinnati and I’m super excited about the opportunity… they have financing options available and one is an ISA (income share agreement). For those that don’t know it’s when you agree to pay back tuition at 10%/paycheck once you land a job making over 40k/year until tuition (~15k) is paid off. Their employment rate after graduation is 92% within 6 months and during the interview they stated that they generally see 50-75% of students receiving job offers before graduating and these stats are backed by a third party fact checker (don’t remember who off the top of my head). 

SO… my question is, is an ISA the right route? my thinking behind it is the boot camp will be more inclined to make sure i secure a job after graduation because that’s the only way they get a return on investment, do you believe my thinking to be true or that I have an equal probability of getting a job offer regardless of using an ISA?"

codingbootcamp,General Assembly Review,1639180152,"Overall: Disappointed.

Everything you will learn is already online and packaged better. It's almost the same as freecodecamp, codecademy, etc. Probably more similar to The Odin Project. Why? Little instructor support leads to googling for hours. However, TOP is structured better.

Our responsive design section lasted in total less than 1.5 hours and no questions were fielded. I understand if we were all experienced devs but it seems odd to cover css selectors and then go straight into building an app. A lot isn't covered or merely mentioned.

About me: 35, College Degree, Exit, self taught for roughly a year. Before my company, I was in sales.

If you don't have the fundamentals you should not consider it. I'm talking decent JavaScript.  I don't know how other bootcamps are structured but this one goes from what is html to a full stack DJANGO app in a few weeks. Pretty sure we never covered git or the terminal. Instructor would get annoyed if someone had a question about cloning a repo.

My JavaScript is okay. Functions were glossed over and their lectures on JS left me confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Good: **learn or die**. It's up to you to figure it out. Unlike self taught, there is a deadline so you will be forced to do. This was helpful.

The Bad: **riff raff**. I hate to be an internet jerk. But it seems to me they found a bunch of washed-up or never-were devs to run through some slides to a hopeful and naive/ill-informed group.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting this because if you are reading this you are probably like me. I went down the rabbit hole of bootcamps and came here quite a bit. I was on the fence and decided to go for it. While it didn't hurt I don't think it helped very much. I believe you're better off figuring it out at your own speed so it clicks. You can't breeze through react in a day.

I'm not going to go into detail about what's covered since I don't want to share HR's material, but essentially I was very confident going through the stuff in the first module and felt like I was comprehending everything as I should've, for the second module it was more difficult but I was able to push through. For this 3rd module, there are two distinct exercises but I don't even have a clue of how to begin. I've only been at this for 3 or so months, but I cannot afford a deferment due to financial constraints. I have 6 days to finish up these final exercises, but I've so far spent 6hrs today and have made absolutely zero progress. In my current state if I were to somehow magically figure it out, would I even be at a sufficient level to join the program? So far I've been in recourse for almost 4 weeks. What was your experience and what recommendations would you have for me. Should I be this lost or is this a clear indication that this isn't for me? I figure the best advice can only be from someone who's successfully gone through it before. Sorry if this is all over the place, a lot of thoughts are going through my head right now.

Just to give an idea of what I'm working on, the final two exercises are based on recursion, I've spent the last 2 days learning recursion and thought I was somewhat ok since I could solve the coding challenges, but the required projects seem to be far beyond my comprehension level.

So long story short, I wanted to ask you guys the expert or someone with coding boot camp or self taught experience which out of those three(freecodecamp, C0D3 or The Odin Project) that I should pick before I start spending my next 6-months diving into their free curriculem or any advice on stopping me and tell me why I should do evething I possibly can to come up with the money(about 20k+living expense for the next 6-months) to do a coding boot camp because it will give me the network, job opportunities, coding knowledge that it will take too long for someone who isn't so smart like me to get and basically buying time with money(with the understanding that I will definitely pass the class because I have the willingness, time and motivation).

Little bit about my last year:

\- Quit my job as an EE in Sept 2020

\- Originally wanted a masters so I enrolled in 2 community college courses (Intro to Python and Intro to SQL)

\- Decided to take the self taught route instead (did research on bootcamps and didn't think they were worth it)

\- Started applying to jobs around March/April after I felt comfortable building fullstack apps. I didn't get many interviews. Felt like I needed a network so I looked into bootcamps again and found Codesmith.

\- Ended up learning a lot more than I thought I would. Recently started my first job as a Software Engineer."

codingbootcamp,How to use switch case in Java?,1638070590," 

**Switch case can be used for multiple cases scenario’s.**

**Ex:-** If you have multiple conditions on the basic of which you would determine something then switch case is the ideal for these kind of queries.

Working example :-

**Query:- If number entered is 1 then print ONE, if 2 then TWO and if it is 3 then THREE.**

**Using switch**

1. switch(identifierForUserValue) 
2. { 
3. case 1:  console.writeLine(‘ONE’) 
4. break; 
5. case 2: console.writeLine(‘TWO’) 
6. break; 
7. case 3: console.writeLine(‘THREE’) 
8. break; 
9. default : console.writeLine(‘Wrong input’) 
10. break; 
11. } 

**Note:-** Yes you can use multiple ***‘If conditions’*** as well but ***‘Switch’*** handle these kind of queries in a better way. In addition of that it has a **‘*****default’*** case as well which executes when no case matches

I hope you understand now.

I left a previous career in tech sales to pursue medicine, but due to covid uncovering some unsavory aspects of medicine, I’m pivoting my sights on the computer sciences and software engineering/development. I have experience with coding and really enjoy it! 

Now my goal is multi-fold:

1) Is like to combine my business background with the technical background in some capacity. Not sure exactly what roles exist here, so some input would be good. 

2) I’d like to one day start my own company and want to boot strap it myself to start. I feel like a bootcamp will help give me enough knowledge to do so. 

3) I want the flexibility to work from anywhere, which I believe this route would allow me to do. Question is what kind of general engineering/rev roles I can expect coming out of a boot camp with a ‘decent portfolio’. I have some cool ideas I’d like to build along the journey to make my portfolio more enticing for employers. I’m also guessing a generic salary range to start would hover around the ~$60k mark, but put me in check there. 

I don’t mind taking out a loan to make this happen, b/c I’d be able to pay it back quickly and don’t have any pre-existing debts.

codingbootcamp,Why do bootcamps get so much crap?,1637601603,"The main concerns I have heard (through my one day of research yesterday) is that #1 many either don’t go in depth to the degree needed to get a job and #2 some don’t prepare you for the job search.

I am going to learn on my own first for free because I am a recent graduate/new educator and I am still getting my footing in education. I also want to make sure this is the career I want to pursue. But I think coding is what I want to switch to. 

I will start with code academy and app academy since they claim they offer free curriculum.

Is there a plan out there by someone or tips from someone about switching? I think bootcamps sound great for someone who has questions often and likes to learn from an actual human. But I also don’t want to choose the wrong one. 

 Basically, I would love to hear peoples experience going through bootcamps and how they prepared you for the job search. I would also like to hear from self-taught coders and what made them stand out. Also, if they would choose this path again if they had to start over."
codingbootcamp,Question about Compensation,1637582236,"Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this belongs here so I apologize if it doesn't. I'm currently trying to decide if I should get an MBA or sign up for a coding bootcamp. To give a little bit of context on me, I'm 29 and I double majored in economics and sociology and I minored in math. I struggled with programming in college (only one class), but I went to a borderline elite college where they taught things very rigorously. I'm in a major metro area that is not SF or Seattle. To be transparent, my main goal is money. I probably have a good chance at the elite (top 15) MBA programs, but I'm wondering if coding might be the better financial decision. Would any past bootcamp grads specifically be willing to comment their salary history by job as well as the metro area they are in? I've seen online that ""experienced"" bootcamp graduates make ""only"" 95k (ish) at their third job and I make almost that much now in a separate field. Any other advice or guidance to help me make this decision is much appreciate :)

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Will any bootcamp graduates specifically share their salary history by job as well as the metro area they are in?"

codingbootcamp,Good for switching from Digital Marketing?,1637362882,"Hi all! Looking for some advice

As a little background, I graduated with a bachelors in psychology. My school asked us to complete another area of sub-study where I took marketing and some intro CS courses. When I graduated I started working in digital marketing where I became the head of web changes at the small company I worked for. The web changes were VERY basic but I really enjoyed doing it, more than some of the other stuff I was doing.  I’m wanting to continue front-end development but eventually move into full-stack. I also have a photography and graphic design portfolio which is limited but still something I have knowledge and skills of. 

I’m considering doing the UIC coding bootcamp which is partnered with fullstack academy ( I think they were bought out?) I’ve read so many positive and negative reviews on bootcamps so I’m not so much looking for general advice as advice specific to my situation.

NOW, my questions lol
- will a bootcamp be a good supplement to my current resume/portfolio? 
-is it common for companies to look for front-end coders with marketing &amp; design experience? or does the marketing &amp; design experience not even matter?
- is it possible to be a full-stack engineer without a CS degree? although I wouldn’t be opposed to going back to school for one if I landed a solid job in the field
- will my previous experience help land me a job out of bootcamp? 

and any other advice you have!"

Hi, REDACTED.

We get a Slack notification with just a few key answers - and we can already tell this is going to be a weird one!  


**#8: Without scrolling around too much...**

*Applicant*: The site is engaging but a bit lacking in identity

*Us (our email response)*: It's pretty loose. We'd agree. We use it as a talking point for that reason / and the students work on improving the various modules as part of the class. We talk a lot about visual language and how to unify things visually. We're OK with how it looks / and using it in that process. Most normal people either like it or don't. They aren't usually educated enough to have much to say about it *yet.* It's fun to see the students come around and start to think about it more critically.

&amp;#x200B;

**#9: Is this company:** (range of new, established, etc)

*Applicant*: Brand new

&amp;#x200B;

**#10: How can you tell?**

*Applicant*: No menu bar. Trying really hard to sell me something while ""not trying"" to sell me anything. The ""this is a call to action!"" line is a prime example. Also points are kind of ""repeated"" or drawn out for too long. Has the vibe of being a 1 - 2 man operation

*Us*: We've never thought of a 'menu bar"" as being a signifier that a  company is brand new. Very interesting. We think that conventions like menus are something to think through. Are they necessary when there's only a few links? How do you want to tell the story? Do the masses really know what 'hamburger' menus are? Would your mom know to click it?

This is a landing page. Its goal is to explain the program and sell you on its value. That's its goal. What would be your suggestions on how to better accomplish that goal?

  
**#11: What type of company is this anyway?**

*Applicant*: a front-end boot camp, with a twist(s).

**#12: What does this company ""do?""**

*Applicant*: Teach the entire web design and development process (research, content-strategy, User Experience, and programming - for The Web)  


**#13: How would you describe the 'Character' of this company?** (multiple choice)

*Applicant*: Graphic Design College, Down to earth, Homemade  

*Us*: This is interesting. It sounds like you don't like the site \[\[based on other responses\]\] - but somehow it feels like a graphic design college. That sounds impressive!  We are happy to appear down to earth and homemade. If that is our goal /  then our design is successful.

&amp;#x200B;

**#20: What VALUE would a student get out of this course?** 

*Applicant*: The value this course provides is a strong focus on an area of work. Many courses are fine delineating the line between Compsci and full-stack but are not willing to truly flesh out the experience. They seemingly always leave something out, whereas here you are (hopefully) taught the entire process from start to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

**#23: How confident are you in the teachers?**

*Applicant*: 0 out of 10

*Us*: We probably wouldn't fill out a form / or eat a sandwich / or spend a  single second on anything that didn't feel &gt;= 8/10.  Why did you decide to fill out this form at all? Do you fill out a lot of forms? Is this type of competitor research something you find interesting? Because there are jobs for that.

&amp;#x200B;

**#35: What teaching style do you prefer?**  (multiple choice) 

*Applicant*: Learn on your own from bad videos, make bad habits, and meet with a 'mentor' for 30 minutes a week, Be on video chat with an obnoxious team of developers for 4 hour periods at a time?80 hours a week full-throttle automated test-driven challenges with no wiggle room, Watch a random teacher's assistant stumble through building a brittle web application, Watch hundreds of hours of Udemy courses by yourself - but pay thousands instead of $15.99, Go to a school of a bunch of really excited young people and get a certificate that no one cares about

*Us*: At this point / we can tell that you are just very impatient. These things (these specific questions/prompts) aren't for *you.* They are for the people who don't know better. 95% of the applicants say that this form was ""fun"" - and that ""It gave them a lot to think  about."" It's not for you. And we'd expect someone who is that aware of it --- to understand that. There are tons of people being taken advantage of who aren't educated or cultured enough to even consider these decision points. It's also a little snarky (on our part) - but that's our choice. However  - in the small chance you really do want these things - you can head over to Career Karma. There's a ton of schools that offer this. And they won't pretend they aren't salespeople.

(*there were many more questions answered like this*)

&amp;#x200B;

**#39: What do you think about this form?**

*Applicant*: Was annoying answering questions where there are clear and obvious ""correct"" answers. Like obviously I want a good learning experience vs ""80 hour non-stop no wiggle room chaos"" learning experience. I already read the talking points on the website, why am I forced to read then all again under the guise of questions and answers

*Us*: We spend an insane amount of time doing this. If someone isn't willing to take part in a 20-minute experiment without freaking out / then we know they aren't going to be a good fit. It's a lot less expensive for us. If you want us to spend an hour talking with you - *for free*  (2 of us) - which is $200 worth of time... - / we aren't forcing anyone to do anything. This is the student screener. It is your choice to fill it out. And like we said, it's very telling how you react.

&amp;#x200B;

**#10: How can you tell?**

*Applicant*: No menu bar. Trying really hard to sell me something while ""not trying"" to sell me anything. The ""this is a call to action!"" line is a prime example. Also points are kind of ""repeated"" or drawn out for too long. Has the vibe of being a 1 - 2 man operation

*Us*: Back to this. We're still trying to figure out where the ""selling"" and the ""not selling"" - and this call to action is. We really can't find it.  It just says what the course is. If anything - in too much detail. It's very bland. Here's what we do. It's very humble. It has Derek right there - just saying how it works / all out in the open on video. and it's not trying to pretend it isn't a 2-3 person operation. It shows us right in the videos. We'd love to hear more about this.

&amp;#x200B;

**#40: So, who are you? Why are you here? What's your back story?**

*Applicant*: I just love computers and technology. Always wanted to work in the field. Found out college won't work for me, so have been figuring out how to proceed next.

&amp;#x200B;

**#41: Do we have permission to email you and invite you to the next group informational meeting with the instructor?** 

*Applicant*: Yes

&amp;#x200B;

**#43: So, any specific questions about the school? Do you have anything else you'd like to add?** 

*Applicant*: The more open you can be, the more I (and many others) will trust you and your course. I don't like being sold something when it's obvious they're trying to make it not like a sales pitch. I don't care if you have a department for sales or not if the experience is the same either way. Giving me a ""call to action"" that's spending $10,000 on your course is lame.

*Us*: We can't really be more open. We're all the way open. On one hand /  you say the story is repetitive and there is too much info / but then you suggest that we could be more open and honest? How does that work?  We help publically for free all the time. We have our faces all over the internet. We give out example lessons. We meet with people and give them free career guidance. We are terrible business people. We are probably too open. What is an example of how we can be more open?

You seem upset about the money part. We're not sure what to tell you. We have to pay bills and stuff. We don't think that paying for schools is very weird. We have an ISA that is dirt cheap / and that we actually get totally screwed on. We're actually going to remove it. 2.5k for a  full-time tutor for 6 months is a stupidly inexpensive system. There is absolutely nothing less expensive than DFTW. No one is selling anything.  We tell you what it is. Try to explain its value - for those who don't understand the industry and the pitfalls of the current educational choices - and then offer a free career guidance session. It just took us an hour to respond to this. It seems like your worldview is warped.  But also / we work with a lot of people on the spectrum and maybe you're just getting hung up on a few key points. You'll have to tell us.

Here's the books we used to design the curriculum: [https://perpetual.education/how-we-designed-our-curriculum](https://perpetual.education/how-we-designed-our-curriculum)

Here's an outline of exactly how it works / straight from the teachers: [https://perpetual.education/stories/how-dftw-works](https://perpetual.education/stories/how-dftw-works)

Here's a free section of the course: [https://perpetual.education/resources/free-responsive-design-challenge-workshop](https://perpetual.education/resources/free-responsive-design-challenge-workshop)

Here's out prices: [https://perpetual.education/tuition-calculator](https://perpetual.education/tuition-calculator)

Should we also take naked pictures of our bodies and post those on the site? How much more open and transparent could we possibly be? Should we stream while we're on the toilet?

What are you comparing us to?

&amp;#x200B;

**#19: How much do you \*really\* want to learn this stuff...** 

*Applicant*: The more open you can be, the more I (and many others) will trust you and your course. I don't like being sold something when it's obvious they're trying to make it not like a sales pitch. I don't care if you have a department for sales or not if the experience is the same either way. Giving me a ""call to action"" that's spending $10,000 on your course is lame.

*Us*: Out of all of the problematic things in this screener --- this is by far the most worrying. Most of the people who are 10/10 still won't make it through. So - the short answer here is that 8/10 isn't enough. We don't admit people who aren't 10/10.

\---

We don't try and talk people into anything. So - if you ever get to 10/10 - you can write us a letter and *beg* us? We're not really sure how it works. Can you please explain it to us?  


Good luck out there, REDACTED. We hope you find what you are looking for.

I am looking at going to a boot camp early next year, but i'm wondering what things I can do that could possibly help me between now and then, so i'm not completely lost. I know many will not recommend it, but i'm in my early 30's, and I want to waste as little time as possible making this transition, so going the 4 year route isn't gonna work for me. I signed up for the Harvard CS50 course and believe I can get that done before I go to a boot camp. Anybody else do something similar? Also, i'm looking at going to General Assembly in Austin. Has anyone else gone there? I'm looking at doing it in person and not remote as I need some structure and hands on learning type of environment. TIA!"

codingbootcamp,"I interviewed five coding bootcamp grads about their journey to learn to code and get a job, here is what I learned.",1636345509,"I interviewed five coding bootcamp grads about their journey to learn to code and get a job. The big reasons why people do bootcamps is that: 

1. they want a structured curriculum 

2. they want to be accountable to turn work in 

3. they want mentorship 

4. they want a community

5. they want the credibility of the bootcamp

6. they want a faster way to get into the industry as compared to a university degree

The hardest parts of studying to get into the bootcamp are 1. knowing where to start, like which language to study and from which resource and 2. finding the time after a long day at work or school--most people opt to quit their jobs to study full time just to get into the bootcamp, something not everyone has the luxury to do. Most people are disappointed to learn that they receive very little mentorship in the bootcamp because instructors are spread thin between lots of students. Most grads reply to over 100 postings or contact hiring managers before finding a job. After starting to interview, most grads realize that they need to know algorithms and data structures but that the bootcamp did not prepare them for it and now they have to spend one or more months to learn the subject. Of the grads that I interviewed that were able to find a job, most opted to contact hiring managers directly rather than reply to job postings. Once hired, it took most grads several months to become productive, and they were hired with the expectation that they would need time to learn. 

If you want to hear their stories yourself, you can check out the Learning to Code interviews at [https://hypothesis.transistor.fm/episodes](https://hypothesis.transistor.fm/episodes). Note, not every interview is with people who chose the bootcamp route, so read the show notes first if that is what you want, and not every episode about learning to code has been posted yet.

Finally, when I broke into software engineering from a non-engineering background, I did so by building a really nice web app that I could show employers. I eventually even taught at a coding bootcamp for nearly a year. You don't need to do a coding bootcamp to get a job, but they do help. There are free resources out there. If you are trying to do full stack development, you can use the free open source curriculum at the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://FreeCodeCamp.org) which will give you everything but the mentorship(which you don't get anyway) and the community(which you can find in other ways.)"
codingbootcamp,Coding Boot Camp Financials,1636341552,"Hello! I’ve been accepted into App Academy but I’m debating on the full time vs. part time program. 

Full time has ISA, but you’re not allowed to work during those 6months. Moving back home isn’t an option for me to minimize cost. Im fully responsible for my expenses. People have suggested taking out a personal loan during this time, but how in the world do you make the monthly payments if you can’t work? Could this be solved with gig work on the weekends?

Full time means you finish faster and have the option of ISA. I feel like this option is great if you’re living rent free or have savings to live off of. Feels incredibly risky if you don’t lol. Also the problem of finding a new job which could take a few months. Funds will probably run out before then.

Part time program is a year long commitment. Doesn’t offer ISA and you will pay $21,000 for the program. AppAcademy works with Climb Credit where you can take out a $19,000 loan but you need to pay $3,000 upfront to cover the rest of the cost. Monthly payments avg. at $639 over a period of 36 months. 

You can still work your full time job and have secure income. But you will also have a lot of work to do. Full time job AND immersive program. You will have to sacrifice your Saturday mornings as well. 

I’m super torn. I actually already have a lot of personal debt and it feels like I’m just adding more on top. The monthly payments for the part time program don’t seem manageable with my current employment. At the same time, I don’t know how I would make the monthly payments for the personal loans for the full time program. 

I would love to hear some advice or any past coding boot alumni’s experience with this. Which program did you go with and how did you manage it financially?

Thank you for your time. 🙏"

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp Interviews,1636246668,"I have started looking into a few coding boot camps, and many of their websites had me just put in my phone number and email and schedule a ""Coding Admission Interview"" before any other information of the application process was revealed. I don't know what to expect from or for this or if I should prepare in any way. The webpages did ask for my phone number and email and to schedule the appointment to ""get information on the program."" So I don't think it would be like a very formal interview at least like not directed towards me, and it would be more for me to get information from them. But I would prefer not to bomb it because of this and not be considered at all.

\-Or if you have attended a boot camp, do you think that this is what I am looking for? Can I learn the skills I need to do something like that? 

I am considering courses that are more about just coding and work up from there, however I am thinking about those of UX/UI, product management and data. I don't accept to get all the information I need to create my ideas in one boot camp, and I am considering completing more than one, as well as just independently learn what I need to learn on my own when that is needed. I am not trying to overcompensate what I can get out of a boot camp. I do think that a lot of what I am trying to acquire for my ideas will have to just come from myself and just doing it and working with the failed attempts. I would like just some formal training and I hear most people can get a job afterwards, which is comforting to fall back on."

I've done some freecodecamp and Udemy, however, I have a hard time with doing self learning. I would like to do a coding boot camp but a lot of them are $13,000 or $20,000. Trilogy is one of the less expensive ones and I've been thinking of doing it. I know so many people that dog on it and I understand why especially since they don't guarantee job placement, I just can't do the self learning anymore.

He has a pretty good salary and we don't need to pay rent. We want to buy our own house in the next maximum 2 year and we have a decent amount of money saved up for the new house.
I am considering to stay home a few more months, maybe until the end of winter. The reason why? I started taking some online coding classes at the beginning of the year and I consider maybe a career in this field. I was working full-time and I didn't have a lot of time after work to take these online classes. Max 1 hour after work every day. I graduated college in 2015, but nothing related to coding (I did English language and literature).
My questions / concerns would be:
I am not sure to stay unemployed a little bit more. Should I? 
Does it worth get into coding?  Whould it be hard to find a job with coding, just with online classes (and maybe some bootcamp) and without any actual college in the field? 
I would mention that we do live in Michigan, US. Colleges are pretty expensive here.

codingbootcamp,Thinking about joining a boot camp - suggested payment options?,1635878110,"I did my research into a few boot camps for software engineering. Thinking about joining Thinkful since they do 50 hours a week for 5 months as full-time, and other boot camps do maybe 30 hour weeks for 12 weeks or so. Need all the learning I can get. 

I'm only doing part time contract work that ends next month and don't have enough saved to pay up front. 

The deferred tuition option has me paying principal plus interest with set payments for 36 months, while the income sharing option is 15% of my income for 4 years or a maximum of $40,000 whichever comes first. 

For those of you who went through a boot camp where you don't start paying until you find a job, what kind of payment option did you choose? Thanks!"

codingbootcamp,Should I go for a coding bootcamp?,1635865482,"Hello everyone! 

I’m a Cybersecurity engineer who graduate with a master's program two years ago and over 5+ years of experience in system support, network engineer, and security engineering. Currently, I hold couple of certifications such as CISSP/GPEN/CCNA and Cloud ( I love learning and challenging myself ).
Coding is one of my weaknesses that I would like to solve and I have been thinking of going to a boot camp (code-smith, full-stack, and coding dojo and others). 

Have anyone done this in the past by going from cyber engineering to a full software engineer immersion course?

I took coding courses before in my undergrad/graduate degree and I dabble into python a bit ( basic). I want to be able to combine cyber Security engineering with software engineering. I plan to target one of the FAANG companies once I’m done ( ). 

Is this a good idea?"

I’ve learned html and css fairly well and have created a handful of personal projects with them. I’m also trying to learn JavaScript but overall I don’t feel my discipline as well as use of free resources is enough for me to get into the industry. At the pace I’m going, it’ll be another 2 years before I get anywhere solid. That being said I’ve tried to find a bootcamp that fits my needs but I can’t seem to find the right one yet. If anyone knows a specific bootcamp that matches this criteria I’d really appreciate it. (Btw I know it’s pretty specific so I’m just hoping I find that perfect fit. 

1. Online only

2. Flexible schedule

3. Deferred payments or ISA

4. Full stack developer preferred but if not, then front end

codingbootcamp,Switching Careers - looking for advice,1635792928,"Not sure if this is the best subreddit, please point me in the right direction. 

I am looking to switch careers into programming/coding and I have 4.5 months left at my current job before I can leave and fully devote to a bootcamp. 

Once I leave I can spend a year working toward a job. 

So far my plan is to work through Code academy courses for the next 4.5 months, I am currently working through Python as well as reading ""Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"". I can usually get about an hour or so a day of practice in during the week and several hours on the weekends. I am looking to use this time to prepare for Bootcamp. 

My goal after I leave from work is to be able to increase the hours of practice I can get in as well as attending a bootcamp and then with my new found skills look/find a a job. 

I am hoping for advice on the first two steps in this process. 

-With my limited time over the next 4.5 months, how can I best spend it top reach my end goal? 

-Once I have left my job, advice on how I should approach the next year. What bootcamps to look at, work I should accomplish before the bootcamp, goals I need to figure out etc. 

Much appreciated. Let me know if there is any more information I can provide."

codingbootcamp,Thoughts on coding bootcamps with no degree,1635770404,"I’ve done a great deal of research into different coding bootcamps and was hoping to score some intel from those that have already gone through them.

My question is, how many of your fellow cohorts have no college degree and were still able to land jobs in the field after bootcamps?

I am 33 with no degree, and I am married with 2 kids and an already demanding full time job. So going back to school at this point in my life would take probably 5-6 years of part time courses to get a Computer Science degree. I found out about these bootcamps and have heard of varying success, but I worry that all these high placement rates are filled with college grads who only did bootcamps to sharpen skills (with only a few outliers sprinkled in).

My current plan is to start with Odin to learn the basics. I’ve heard once you fall behind in these bootcamps, you can just get left behind and even wash out. I want to take a few months and learn what I can so I am not completely starting from zero. After a lot of research, I have it narrowed down to probably either Codesmith or Hack Reactor. Neither of which are cheap, but seem to be some of the top options. I am also completely open to suggestions, I narrowed it down to them because of reputation and help with job searches after graduation.

I have no delusions of grandeur that I’m going to graduate from the bootcamp and have a 6 figure job offer waiting for me. My hope is that I can get my foot in the door somewhere with a junior position and learn more on the job. Then maybe down the line I can parlay that into something higher up…but one step at a time right?

Long story short, would I be wasting my time and money on these bootcamps? I’m fearful that I’ll spend the money, know a lot about coding, and still be told “thanks but no thanks” because I didn’t take Psychology 101 classes in college.

Thanks all!"

I’m starting to get a better grip on things now but I still am behind and that’s frustrating for me as I’m usually quite quick on learning stuff, and we’re getting into deeper stuff.

codingbootcamp,Will it be difficult to find a job after completing bootcamp with no degree?,1635722062,"Hello,

I am a current Computer Science student who is about to start Thinkful's engineering flex program. I know the smart thing would be to finish my degree, however I cannot afford college at the moment so I am hoping to gain employment as a web developer and work towards my degree part-time in the future.

I've seen that Thinkful and other bootcamps typically claim high employment rates post-completion. However, it also seems that a lot of bootcampers possess college degrees; even if non-tech related. 

Will it be possible/likely to find a decent job having no degree? This is assuming I excel in the courses and become a skilled developer and build an impressive portfolio. My only concern is that having no degree will hold me back

since i’m going to learn this on my own, i was thinking about starting it at my own pace after my bootcamp finishes JavaScript. this way, it’s still fresh in my head and doing this JavaScript master class course by Colt Steele which my friend also recommended. after we finish JavaScript we learn a completely different language.

I’ve been struggling to get into tech especially I’m always busy working 60 to 70 hours a week to afford paying my bills  so almost no free time to code.
My plan was saving enough money for a 6 months expenses including my rent and quit my job and dedicate my whole time to code and build a portfolio and show it to recruiters later to get a job since I don’t have any previous tech experience. 
But recently I was reading a lot of people they got a job through a bootcamp so I changed my mind and I decided to give it a try and take advantage of their networking to get a job fast after graduation.
But during my research I came across a bootcamp called per scholas and I took a look at their software engineer program, but it seems they focus on the basics more, so now I’m very confused about if that bootcamp is good for me or not and if they really connect their alumni to recruiters after graduation and support them till they get a job.

codingbootcamp,Nucamp 11 Month Complete Software Engineering Bootcamp,1635194839,"Hello everyone, I just figured I'd get some conversation going about this 11 month program that Nucamp is offering, as well as ask some questions. For those aware of nucamp, it is a combination three of their offerings, taken in sequence. First is development fundamentals, then back end, then their full stack web + mobile course. I haven't seen much conversation online for this particular bootcamp, but it seems like a good idea for someone in a situation like my own.  


Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's a bit about my background. I am currently in my last semester of a Software Development Associate degree from my local community college. As most of you know, this has done little to prepare me for careers but has given me a nice amount of theory. I decided to go for my A+ cert and just got hired doing IT Support for a small software company, because I'm just not prepared to be a dev and need something resembling a career now. I want to be a web developer, but aside from my college courses, and some DIY websites thrown together with HTML, CSS, and JS I really don't have any acumen in the web dev space. 

This brings me to my plan. My girlfriend and I are moving out, and she has nursing school for the next year, which will leave me paying for more of the bills as her practicals will take upwards of 40 hours per week toward the end of the year. So, more college is off the table for the next year. Long run my plan is to get a bachelors, and I actually have 1 semester done at a local uni. I want to do this 11 month bootcamp thing, and read that they have a ""fair student agreement"" and part time classes which seems much more reasonable than the competition. I like working in groups and really like to have encouragement, I'm an extrovert and enjoy feeling that I'm part of something while I learn so a bootcamp seems like a good fit for me.  


Summary of covered topics:  
1.) Fundamentals - HTML, CSS, JS

2.) Back end - SQL, Python, frameworks  
3) Full stack - React, mongoDB, other frameworks

Link to the bootcamp mentioned: [https://www.nucamp.co/complete-bootcamp/software-engineering](https://www.nucamp.co/complete-bootcamp/software-engineering)  


In summary, after this is over, my qualifications will be:  
A.) 1+ year of technical support experience  
B.) A.S. in software dev  
C.) A robust portfolio via my experience at nucamp

With that in mind, I have some questions for the community, if anyone is willing/able to give any input:

1.) I plan to apply my full effort to building my portfolio with nucamp, as such will I be considered a viable candidate for entry level front end web development jobs with my qualifications?  
2.) Could anyone here share their experience job hunting after graduating nucamp or any other bootcamp?  
3.) Are there any major knowledge gaps I will have as a dev given the skills taught at this bootcamp compared to others?"

I just joined this group to ask some questions and get some insights. I have worked as an aerospace engineer for about 3 years (2017 - 2020). I quit working last year during pandemic because of long hours (12hours/day, sometimes 16 hours) and my mental and physical health. 

I took about 5 months of break but I wasn't just chilling and doing nothing but was planning and thinking about my next chapter. I decided to go to graduate school (aerospace) so I applied for the school. Early this year, I got accepted into the graduate school so I was planning to start this autumn. I did not want to waste my time so I was thinking about what I should do for this summer. 

I have always wanted to learn coding and also it would have helped for my master's program because I was planning to study Guidance, Navigation, and Controls field. So, I started a bootcamp in June and did it for 12 weeks. I did not have any coding background so I was quite overwhelmed with the amount of work but I started enjoying the program and really fell into it. I spent about 10-12 hours working on homework and projects. The bootcamp was for the Full-Stack Web Development so the curriculum did not cover the DSA that much.

Towards the end of the bootcamp, I started thinking about switching career to software from aerospace. Of course, that was not a spontaneous thoughts as I asked my software engineer friends about work life balance, salary, culture, etc. I eventually withdrew from the aerospace master's program and decided to pursue software industry.

The real problem came after I finished the bootcamp and of course I felt very lost what to do. I just started taking DSA course in Udemy and solving some easy Leetcode problems but I feel like I am going down the rabbit hole with no clear path. Some of my friends suggested me going back to school and get a CS degree but I was not sure if that is the optimal choice. 

Could anyone give me their experience or thoughts on how and what to prepare after the bootcamp to get a job as a software engineer (preferably backend)? I keep telling myself that I am committed to switch career and prepare to work hard but I feel very lost and not confident about how I am preparing... I would appreciate a lot if anyone shares their experience or thoughts. Thank you so much in advance!"

codingbootcamp,Coding file based on twitter mentions,1634750776,"I want to use twitter as a metric to calculate number of US politicians that are named every day and pinpoint them on a map. For example ""Sheldon Whitehouse"" = +1 from Rhode Island.

I will be building this program on AWS to help me provision the massive information that will be running through this program that would continuously be talling up the mentioned of these politicians..

Since there are only 100 Senators it wouldn't need to look for more than 100 names..  
Additionally, i'd also like for the program to use search key words with these names such as: vaccines, republican, democrat, fake.. after it finds the name on twitter.

All this information would need to be compiled in an Excel spreed sheet that i would then use to draw an interactive database.

On the Excel the graph would show these parameters:

Name of Politician, state, key word #1, keyword #2, keyword #3, number of times mentioned, estimated growth prediction.

Since i need this program to run on AWS, i would need the information compiled on Excel and you would write the code to run on the server for these searches that would then be added on Excel.

Does anyone know what kind of program i would need to write to analyze tweets and the program i would use to make the states a darker color based on the number of mentions like the example below?

I would be happy to pay you for your time, thank you.

I just finished the application process to start General Assembly’s software engineering immersive course with an income share agreement. I have a few months before the course starts and I came across a new free program my state started that helps residents enter tech. The program is basically a year long paid apprenticeship where you work alongside mentors within the company to learn software engineering basics.

My dilemma is that I already have loans I’m paying off from my undergrad and don’t love the idea of taking out an ISA on top of that with no job guarantee. My hesitation with the state program is that it’s so brand new that I have no way of knowing how good it actually is BUT it’s technically job experience on my resume right out of the gate, which is something I know boot camp grads struggle with when they’re applying to jobs with no real world experience.

(For more context this is the Illinois DPI tech ready program that started last year)

codingbootcamp,"Is there any way to get tutoring, code review, and interview coaching outside of a bootcamp?",1634059418,"I saw pramp mentoring but it's $800 for 4 hours and at that would reach the cost of a bootcamp fast. Is there anything else out there that would cover the above?

I'm a cs grad. I need new portfolio projects because the older ones are too old to discuss (I don't even want to put one of those languages on my resume). I have holes in my learning because the projects were our coding courses and it wasn't code reviewed. I got away with bad code as long as the project worked. 

I need a solid programming course with code review to make sure I don't end up with frankenstein projects by the time I'm done (so TOP or other free courses don't quite fit my needs). I also need to fill in those learning gaps as I only learned what I needed to complete the tasks; I can tinker with a few languages but I don't know any one of them really well. I also need to be able to discuss the components of the projects and coding principles which I never learned (again, we were mostly required to make projects work). 

I'm not in a bad spot to get interviews. I had nontechnical positions since graduation but I was able to leverage my technical knowledge to improve processes and wrote scripts for my current job that I use regularly to get things done more efficiently. But I need projects and fill in my learning. I especially need help with technical interviews because discussing technical topics (after working in non-tech jobs and explaining technical things to non-technical people every day) is a foreign concept to me. Technical discussions also didn't happen verbally in school. I basically need to learn to defend my degree. 

That probably puts me in an ideal position to benefit from a bootcamp but I'm wondering if there are other options."

codingbootcamp,A criticism on the coding bootcamp industry,1633727178,"QUICK HISTORY: I'm 23 years old. Been in college since 2016. First studying biology, then switched to biochemistry, and finally about to graduate with a degree in computer science. However, during the period between biochem and comp sci, I was extremely close to starting bootcamp at App Academy. In fact, I called and cancelled during the grace period on the very day my cohort started. I then enrolled at an online accredited university for a computer science degree, graduating in December. more about that later.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very glad I decided to make that decision. The problems I see with coding bootcamps ever since enrolling in a degree program are 

1.)  Snake-like marketing scheme:

Many market themselves with job guarantees and shotty statistics which at first glance may seem very inticing (it was for me). In reality, these job guarantees often turn out to be inaccurate causing many to fall into a job search that does not end.  Let's analyze this logically. As a hiring manager, if I randomly choose two resumes for a software developer role, both with quality relavant to the job projects as experience, and one says BS Computer Science and the other says \[Insert bootcamp name\] graduate, there is little no chance the bootcamp grad is being chosen over the CompSci grad. It wouldn't make any sense. Why tell people this is a reality when indeed it is not? No offense to any bootcamp grads, but the jobs that will call back are the ones that have no comp sci applicants or comp sci applicants with very poor resumes. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Curriculum

Bootcamps dont teach any of the theory/mathematics I have taken during my time as a CS undergrad. Learning how to practically programming may sound fine and dandy, but having a deep fundamental understanding of how your code will scale, the time complexity of your algorithms, and the data structures associated with those algorithms is NECESSARY information. This is seemingly glossed over at many coding bootcamps as unimportant. The discrete mathematics is so valuable to learn too especially referring to set theory and modular arithmetic. These are things that will be go-to tools in some programming problems and interview questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, if you have no prior experience in IT, I would highly suggest pursuing a bachelors degree no matter how many people try and sell you on the shortcuts. I will not disclose the bachelor's degree programming I'm attending as not to look like a shill, but It is acreditted both regionally and nationally, allows you to complete as many classes as you can per term (if you can finish all your classes in one term, you'll earn your degree in one term \[i am currently in first term almost graduated\]), and has included all the courses I would have missed out on during the bootcamp route. There are other, cheaper, more effective options for breaking into the industry.

 Good luck"
codingbootcamp,Flatiron vs App Academy vs Fullstack Academy,1633725197,"Dunno exactly how to put this together without going off on a tangent but, I will do my best. So currently I am looking at 4 coding bootcamps: Flatiron, App Academy, Fullstack and Tech Elevator. The reason the title only shows three out of the four is because those are the ones that caught my eye(Flatiron, App Academy, and FullStack). Tech Elevator was recommended by a friend who recently graduated and is going through the hiring process.   


A little backstory, I'm from New York and at first I was in college but, I never finished as there were some personal circumstances getting in the way. I have done college twice and could not continue because of such personal circumstances. I was considering Flatiron because my sister told me a friend of hers went through a Bootcamp and got into Google and just before I could start, I was kicked out of my house and moved in with a friend. Luckily, that friend was also studying computer science in college. However, even though that was good for the start of my coding journey, I was stuck in a perdicament: Work to pay rent and learn on my own or Stick with a coding bootcamp. I chose to learn on my own two years ago, especially since the pandemic just began. Worst of all, my job was essential so I had to learn, work, and...well survive, I guess, but, I am not the only one who had to do this I'm sure. So the things I have gone through as I self taught myself were some of freecodecamp, still currently doing that, also gone through Cs50's intro to computer science but, I have not done the final project as of yet. I am reading some programming books such as The Bible of Algorithms and Data Structurres and the Pragmatic Programmer but, I feel as though there are many gaps in my knowledge and hurdles that I still need to cross. Luckily, I was able to move again and I am in a better living condition but, I am not sure for how long so I am making a ""life changing"" decision for myself and I want to pick the right one.  


Those hurdles include Algorithms, the bane of my coding existence BUT, I am still practicing no matter how difficult they are. I still have intentions to learn SQL and Python because of my love for robotics. I have read many subreddit posts and articles on whether or not going to a coding bootcamp was a good idea. This has led me to decide 4 TIME whether or not I wanted to try a coding bootcamp and now I want to give it my utmost attention. Now currently I am in the technical interview process for FullStack and Flatiron, I am in the midst of doing the coding test for App Academy so, now comes the reason I am posting right now.   


I want to make sure I have as much feedback from each three to four coding as I can before I can decide on the One. And I understand that with what I knwo so far, I might not need a coding bootcamp but, they offer resources that I do not have as well as mentors, assignments, and projects that I can go through and put into my resume. Even then, it would not stop me from continuing learning programming and bettering my skills for a future in this field. I just want to make the right decision. So, can you help me out with what ever you know. (Also a Bonus: If you have resources to help me with my algorithms and data structures. Other books for JavaScript and Python, if you know any good ones? That would be amazing!) Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this!    


PS: I will be asking this similar question in other subreddits so bare with me if you see it. I just want to broaden my horizen for more information."

codingbootcamp,"It's been seven months since graduating from my coding bootcamp and due to a slew of unexpected life events, I don't know what to do.",1633314240,"Prior to my coding bootcamp, I was a fine arts student who couldn't find a job. I can't begin to tell you the countless times people asked me about ""going back to school"" so I could ""get a better education"", recruiters and other interviewee's telling me that my ""arts degree"" is ""useless"".

Overall, that job-seeking time in my life was pretty hectic and emotionally draining.

Eventually, a friend mentioned programming to me, and I fell in love.

I never thought a stereo-typical ""creative"" like me could fall in love with something so ""out of my realm"", but, I did.

I considered going back to school to get my BS in CS, but, it would have taken four years and I didn't have the time, nor finances. So, I applied, and was soon accepted into a bootcamp. I took out an ISA loan and made it my goal to put my heart and soul into the program.

The bootcamp itself was intense, rigorous, and challenging. But at the same time, I was battling living in a severely abusive household that made it difficult overall.

I couldn't focus well on projects, and barely passed most assessments and projects given.

But, at the end of the day, I graduated.

However, life threw me a major curveball after graduating from my coding bootcamp.

Nearly a month after graduation, I was kicked out and was homeless for a handful of weeks. Luckily, I was able to keep my ground and am now living with friends.

It's been seven months since graduating from my coding bootcamp and I feel incredibly discouraged.

In a nutshell, life threw me a major curveball after graduation.

Within those months following me being kicked out from my family's house, I've had to put coding and the job search aside completely.

Since then, I've taken up a freelance writing job for now but am seriously itching to get back into coding so I can make my way back into the job hunt and find a well-paying job I enjoy.

But, to be frank, I have no idea where to start.

I've forgotten most everything I learned from the bootcamp. My GitHub is empty. My projects are nonexistent (it was incredibly hard for me to complete the bootcamp suitably because of my abusive living situation).

Now that it's seven months out and I'm just now beginning to get a footing, I don't know where to begin. If anything, I feel like I need to start all over and self-teach myself because I don't have access to the materials and resources from the bootcamp anymore since it's been so much time past.

I'm concerned about how this will look on a resume. I'm concerned about how to even begin, what to study, etc. I still have this 20k ISA loan looming over my head that's also giving me a lot of anxiety.

At this point, I'm just looking for words of encouragement, advice, and help because I really don't know what to do, and I'm feeling incredibly discouraged."
codingbootcamp,Python in Coding Bootcamps for JS,1633306318,"Hi all!  
I'm planning on switching careers from psychology to tech! I have no experience with coding at all but am slowly learning the basics. I'm in NJ so I'm looking at NY based coding bootcamps even though I know everything is online now!   
The ones I'm looking at all focus on JS but from many videos I've seen, Python is the way to go? I'm not sure if this has been addressed anywhere else but I just wonder why? Some videos that are ""things I would change if I could start again"" or ""tips for beginners"" suggest learning python bc of how easy it is compared to other programming languages. Having dabbled very little in both, I do see how Python is much more straightforward and simple!  
So I guess my overall question is, should I still study Python if I want to get into a bootcamp (Fullstacks, Flatiron, Codesmith), or go the classic JS way since that's what will be used ?   


Thank you!"

**Problem Description** 

Little Pony owns a shipment company. There is a priority value and a weight associated with each package. To ship in a single batch with priorities **P1, P2, ...., PK**, they charge- 

**K**  
 **∑ Pi\*(K+1-i)** 

**i=1** 

Now, they have a queue of **N** packages to be shipped. The weight of **ith** package is **A\[i\]\[0\]** and its priority is **A\[i\]\[1\]**. They can not ship the **ith** package until **i - 1 th** package is shipped. Also, they can ship atmost **B** total weight of package at a time. 

They can use multiple batches to ship the packages.  
 Help Little Pony nd the maximum amount they can charge. 

**Problem Constraints** 

1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2 x 105 

1 &lt;= A\[i\]\[0\] &lt;= 5000 

\-5000 &lt;= A\[i\]\[1\] &lt;= 5000 

1 &lt;= B &lt;= 109 

B &gt;= max(A\[i\]\[0\]), so it is always possible to ship all items, as B is greater than maximum weight package. 

**Input Format**

codingbootcamp,Are longer bootcamps better?,1633112391,"So I have been looking at different bootcamps lately, and how they are structured to see what is best for me. I came across code academy who offers a part time in 16 weeks to learn 1 full stack, and optional 2 more stacks, 8 weeks each. Full time, they combine all of them, whereas pretty much every other one I cam across only concentrate on 1.

So, I think my main concern now is, should I pick one that concentrates one one and try to really get that one down, or maybe do a bootcamp that may be shorter, whereas I may not get as much learning.

Some bootcamps teach 1 stack that takes like 12 weeks, and some others are longer/shorter."

codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp with ISA,1632822647,[removed]
codingbootcamp,getting my first BS at 45 or going to a coding bootcamp???,1632795892,"So I'm having a mid-midlife crisis where I hate my career path, and have also discovered that I am very interested in becoming a web developer. I am in healthcare and have really become drawn to finding a niche in healthcare tech to eventually transition into software development maybe with a healthcare software company or something along those lines. I do not have coding experience , I am currently learning Python. 

A few things that are really confusing how I should go about this are:

No college degree - due to some life circumstances I never finished college. I went to community college years ago to get into nursing, and realized I hated nursing and never graduated. I did manage to complete a lot of general education courses though.

I am going to be 40 next year.  

The two camps that I keep reading opinions from seem to be:

get a college degree because you won't get a job without one. Taking this advise, I actually enrolled in my state college and am currently in the first 2 required courses towards a CS degree. However since I can only go part time (2 classes a semester) It will take me about 4-5 years to finish this degree due to all the prerequisite Math that I never took before (cal I, II, III, etc).

and the second camp is:

don't waste your time and money on a four year cs degree, go to a bootcamp and build a portfolio because your not getting any younger. This is iffy for me because I feel like people that succeed in bootcamps already have an unrelated college degree or some coding experience, which I do not have. Will I be spending thousands of dollars just to be turned away for every job due to no degree?

Since I work full time (and am a caregiver to a senior parent)  I cannot do both a cs degree and coding bootcamp. I also cannot take more than 2 classes a semester. I really am interested in learning this skill and I am so far not doing bad in my classes. Who knows when the math classes get harder how I will do, but I would like some thoughts from people in this field.

I know that ultimately it is up to me and how much time and dedication I put into it, and I am willing to do the work, I am just trying to pick the right path for me based on these other factors. Maybe I am overthinking the age thing, maybe not. Any thoughts would be appreciated."

I though they were like cheap online alternatives to a CS degree but I looked it up and saw that some require over *$10,000* to attend. What are these things and why do they cost so much?"
codingbootcamp,I’m not sure what to do anymore. I graduated in March and am now 20k in debt. Dealt with family abuse during/after bootcamp so I barely have anything to show for it. Need advice.,1632629163,"I graduated in December 2019 with my degree in art, a minor in english. When I graduated, I had no job experience at all. I lived with my parents.

Fast forward two years, after sending out nearly 600+ applications for a myriad of jobs, I couldn't get anything. A friend told me about coding, so I took a stab at studying for it by myself. Fell surprisingly in love with the complexity of it all, so I decided to pursue it. So? I joined a coding bootcamp.

Still living at home, things started getting rough. My house eventually became an abusive environment. It was hard for me to focus, let alone get the most simple of tasks done while at the bootcamp.

Four months later, I graduate the coding bootcamp, with one barely finished project and barely anything to show for it. Well... aside from being now 20k in debt.

I tried my hand at getting jobs in coding while self-teaching but it became rough. Eventually during a luck-of-the-draw interview, the interviewee ended up telling me how she only interviewed me because of my ""cover letter"" and because ""i wrote well"". She inquired why I wasn't going for something like UX design and told me I should pursue it because of my ability to write well and have an eye for design.

So, I started self-teaching UX/UI Design. Spent months working on building up a single passion project and starting applying for jobs in that realm. Still radio silence.

During this time, things at my home became violent, so I decided to up and leave and move in with my partner.

Ever since moving in with my partner, I've tried figuring out what to do.

I've tried pursuing software development, but barely remember anything from the course due to family issues/trauma. I enjoyed what I did, but I'm unsure of whether it'd be something feasible to consider knowing I'll have to try and find a place of my own in six months. And well, after taking a look at the r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions subreddit, it seems like it takes more than a year for most self-study programmers to land a job.

When it comes to a career/job?

If I'm being 100% honest, if someone came to me tomorrow and said, ""You could be a fulltime illustrator, selling your work on Etsy, etc., pay all of your bills, pay your own health insurance, set up a 401k, etc and be able to have a little extra money left over for emergencies..."" I would do it in a heartbeat. No questions asked. But, considering my current situation, I don't know/think if that's even feasible.

For personal reasons, I'm not going to have a place to live in six months/I'll need to be able to independently support myself in six months. 

Due to my income agreement/debt from the bootcamp, I owe a hefty 20% of my monthly income to the debt once I reach a job that pays 40k. After crunching my own finances, I'll at the very least need a job that pays $55k+ starting to survive (In terms of freelance? I'll need a job that pays at least $60 hourly pre-tax, as freelancers have to pay a lot in terms of taxes, so, I'll need to cover for that expense as well as retirement/health insurance.)

I've considered freelancing full-time by starting my own branding, low-code design company to pay the bills and then illustrate on the side, but I'm not sure if that would pay well/there be a niche for it. I have strong experience in writing, branding, using squarespace (basic understanding of wordpress), but I'm not sure if I'd be able to build a successful business off of those skills.

I've also considered freelancing because, if no one's giving me opportunities I know I can excel in, then why not create them for myself? But again, I'm just worried about not being able to make a solid/consistent living off of it.

In terms of a full-time job, I'd be open to pursuing software development if there would be a possibility of a job in six months time after self-study, I just have no idea of where or how to begin with that. The one thing that holds me to pursuing a full-time job versus a freelance income is the fact that there is consistency and I'd be able to leave work at work. There's stability, schedule, and a confident sense of financial independence that comes with it. It would also give me the time to pursue my real passion after hours and not have to worry about covering health insurance, PTO, 401k, etc.

Basically as a TL;DR:

After years of applying to a myriad of jobs, I decided to pursue a coding bootcamp. During this time, I was struggling with family issues. Because of these issues, I barely took anything out of the bootcamp because it was hard to focus.

Left the bootcamp now 20k in debt and barely anything to show for it.

Now that I may not have somewhere to live in six months, I need to find a way to support myself financially and find a job that at least pays 55k starting in order to cover my basic + health needs and my bootcamp debt.

I can't decide between trying my hand at software engineering again (even if I don't know where to start with that), and try and get a job in six months time after self-study.

OR

Go the freelance route. If no one's willing to give me a chance, why not make my own way? If I went this route, I would need to make $60 hourly minimum in order to survive (taking into account freelance taxes, health insurance, cost of health prescriptions, and my 20k coding debt). If I went this route, I was considering setting up different sources of income (tee shirt designs, stickers, ...) while also pursuing branding/squarespace design as a career. Once I got on my feet, I would then more actively pursue freelancing.

I don't know which way to go, but, I need help figuring it out sooner than later and felt this would be the best place to ask. So, that said, any advice?

(I apologize if any of the above is a bit all over the place, sort of currently struggling with a panic attack as I type this all out. I really appreciate your help.)"

codingbootcamp,Is coding a good midlife career change career,1632440833,I'm 41 and went to school for Micro Computer  Software Technology my freshman and sophomore year but moved and never finished in the mid 90s.

Is a Coding University that i don't have to pay anything till I get finished and a job paying 50k worth it or can i learn free.
codingbootcamp,surprise surprise - looking for a front end Bootcamp!,1632418609,"So -   
I've been studying myself coding for the last 10 months, mainly with Udemy and freeCodeCamp, and because I feel like I need some review and proper feedback on my work and especially with JS I am looking for a Bootcamp.  
what I mainly look for is a remote Bootcamp (not in the US timezone), up to 6 months that can help me as well understand how to find a job in the industry as a freelance (Nomad life..) and maybe as well how to do interviews and get a job that isn't freelance.  
it is important for me that the instructors that help me are people who actually have some experience and not just people who finish the Bootcamp and now practice their knowledge.  
as almost everyone here I'm on a budget but ill just look into what you recommend and see if it might be a fit.  
\- I had a look at Freemote and at the moment I reckon this is the fittest to what I want mainly because of the code review and the preparation to freelance work, but I will want to know more than Shopify development in the future, but it might be a good place to start. if you have any idea if I should or shouldn't do it I appreciate the feedback!

I’m currently in the September cohort in week 1 and am finding that it is not remotely beginner friendly. They advertised this as something someone with no coding experience could do but I’m not finding that to be the case. The videos speak as if you already know how to do half the commands, and don’t actually give directions on basic commands that you will rely on for the rest of the course.

If it doesn’t improve, I’m afraid I will need to drop the course as it was a massive investment and I can’t afford to miss the drop period.

Has anyone done this program and can shed some light on how someone with very little/outdated coding experience could possibly get past even week 1?"

I admit to procrastinating and submitted most of my homework the week before the program ended. I did speak to my professor and he said I was still able to submit them. There were two assignments that were submitted but still needed grading by the last class day. I contacted my professor and TA and they were finally graded 9/16. Once they were graded my professor told me to email my SSM(student success manager) to verify that I’m all clear to receive my certification. I finished the program with an A. The SSM let me know the homework I submitted late was for my own benefit and wouldn’t count towards completion which confused me. I sent her a screenshot of what my professor sent me and she apologized and then set up a meeting with the university to get an exception. It’s been a couple of days and just now received notice that the university denied the exception because “turning in homework so late posed a danger to the University.  The bottom line is that the University has denied our requests to make an exception for you, because it would impact the program and potentially impact all future students.” My professor apologized profusely today and offered to write me a letter of recommendation for any job I choose to apply to in the future.

I have no plans of becoming a full time developer, but since I have to work actively with tech teams and I like coding, I feel having a good understanding of front and backend development would help.

The reason behind looking at bootcamps were because I really need a push + clear timelines to keep me motivated. However, the cost is really demotivating me :(

So here's what I plan to do:

Time in hand: 6-9 months. (1-3 hours everyday)

Courses planning to cover:
1. Start with Colt Steele Web Developer Bootcamp to get a good understanding at a high level. (2 months)
2. Dive into Jonas JavaScript course (1.5 months)
3. Learn a bit of SQL and NoSqL (1 month) &lt;We use NoSQL&gt;
4. Dabble in Node JS (1.5 months)

Keep a month or two as buffer in case I need more time.

What do you think do this plan? Should I learn something else also? Is there any cheap bootcamp with clear deadlines? I know Udemy's is the cheapest but any suggestions are welcome."

I am currently in school for my general Associates degree and I am looking into signing up with a coding bootcamp. The reason why is because I work retail and I am very tired of working customer service and sales. I have always had a passion for technology and always wanted to get into coding but don't exactly know where to start. I was referred to look up coding bootcamps but I also want to make sure I am not going to waste my money.  Out of my research I have been doing the top 3 boot camps that have caught my eye are the Coding Dojo, The Tech Academy, and App Academy. But ideally  I am most interested in the Coding Dojo because of their curriculum. On their website it shows they go over the basic web development languages like HTML CSS but also goes into Python, Java, and C# and java script. Which is what truly caught my eye as that most of the other academy's curriculum doesnt really touch base on java or c#. I would like to know what your honest thoughts are and if you went to any of these bootcamps what your experience was?

Ask me anything and I'll be brutally honest. 

My personal opinion though, if you don't want to ask something specific, is that its not worth it. Or at least it definitely isn't now. I definitely think it's overpriced for what you actually get out of it. 

So here are some key points.... 

1: they used to have senior devs teaching. That's not the case anymore. a/A Graduates teach it now. 

2: If you get a job it's because you worked hard, not because they gave you some secret sauce. 

3: As a student I had a pretty good time. It was fun and my lead instructor was amazing. 

4: As an instructor they've started taking in more students than I think they should. I mean I had to somehow help over 100 people during module one. I mean I wasn't alone in helping... But our team was super small. They suffered from that. Like week two assessment was notorious for failing 20+ students every time. 

5: it's pretty easy to get kicked out. They have a pretty intense expectation for punctuality. You're permitted 10 strikes before you're removed and have to pay for the course without their ""job search help"". You get strikes by being more than 5 minutes late for a checkin which must be done three times a day, and missing a nightly report. I advocated so hard as an instructor for not making those reports mandatory. Made me sad to see people get kicked out over that. Definitely heart breaking from the instructors side.

6: The instructors are great people. Seriously they try really really hard to make up for the fact that they're understaffed. Please be nice to them if you go. 

7: I did get a job. But I didn't have job search help. More because I didn't need it as I had buddies in the industry that put me in touch with recruiters and management.

Looks like they offer a few cbt videos for various IT skillsets and also this work experience program. In which I think they just assign you task similar to what you would get in an enterprise company, at least thats what the little info I could pull from the vague answers support gives.

As the title says - I’ve done all of code academy, dataquest.io and some code wars. I’ve made bots and done a small pygame project that turned out well. 

I’ve narrowed it down to either software engineering or data science. 

I’d like to work for a FAANG company but I’d be happy to start at a smaller place and grow with them. 

My dad is generous enough to offer to pay and I recently became unemployed so I plan on starting ASAP and diving in head first, full time /online.

I’ve done some research but it’s so intimidating. Each school has a few YouTube videos of people raving and some people saying it’s horrible. 

So far - I like app academy, tech elevator, flatiron, hack reactor and fullstack academy (not a short list , I know)

codingbootcamp,Staying enrolled in a bootcamp - YES OR NO?,1631061781,"Over the last year, I took TONS of coding workshops/classes (including a part-time, 60 hour front end web development course) to help me decide whether or not I should pursue a career change. I loved the majority of the coding classes, received good feedback from instructors / people in the field, so I decided to attend a full-time program after no less than 6 months of researching and self-teaching. I was accepted into reputable bootcamp this summer and have been in it for 1 week and 1 day. Already, I am beginning to question whether I made the right decision and I'd love other folks' feedback on whether or not I should potentially just bag this and get most of my money back. Everyone in my personal life is ""RAH RAH RAH RAH, GO FOR IT"" so I'd love some actual, honest feedback from people who have been in my shoes as a bootcamp student. 

Here's the two reasons I'm considering dropping out:   
\+ I have major challenges with Javascript and I am not sure I can overcome these challenges. I understand the basic concepts, I can write out basic functions and loops, I can manipulate the DOM if I have cheatsheets and can visually see the page, but I question whether or not I can get past this skill level. I am diagnosed with dyscalculia and have MAJOR challenges with writing out javascript syntax and logic, especially once it starts being 100+ lines of code. It takes me twice as long as other people to figure out the order of a function and whether or not things are backwards or forwards, etc. We just started javascript classes today and I literally got everything mixed up, writing out the syntax completely backwards. I just feel like this early struggle with javascript might be a sign I'm doomed and my brain isn't right for this.

\+ I'm in a computer engineering/full stack development camp, but I am not really interested in a programming job, per se. I want to be a web designer or a front end web developer or a content manager. My bootcamp admissions person and I talked about me doing something with UX vs coding, but I took a  during my research period and it was SO BORING. I HATED it. That's why I went with coding vs UX - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE CODING WHEN I GET DOWN TO IT. However, now that I'm in an engineering-type class, I really wonder if UX would have been a better fit. If so, why bother with a bootcamp that isn't really appropriate for what I want to do??? 

At this point, I have until the end of the month to drop out and save most of my money. We are going into our first project and my experience with it and grade on the project will probably determine my ultimate fate, but I'd love this subreddit's feedback. I just feel like such a loser for considering dropping out. I was so excited about this, but now I am not sure if this was the right decision for me. I can easily fall back on my old career, so it's not like this determines the rest of my life, but I just feel so conflicted and would love some feedback from people. Thanks so much!!"

In between chomps of whatever bar snack are up there, he'll say - ""There are two *teams*... you get three *outs*... there's a *bat*... and some *bases*.""

He may even get to talking about a ""*double*"" or an ""*error*"" - (if he thinks you're cute).

And if you want, you can then say - ""**Oh. Yeah. OK.** ***I get it***.""

## Are you an expert yet?

Have you ever played baseball? You may get *the gist* of some of the rules. I get the gist of the rules of *most* languages. First, you look at someone in the eyes and then smile and greet them and tell them what you want and then they give it to you. I get it. **Life**. It's easy. You just ask for whatever you want, and you get it. (well... *I actually believe that's mostly true*) --- *back to the point*.

## Feeling like you ""Get"" the idea isn't the same as deeply knowing something.

How long does it take to become a proficient baseball player? It takes quite a long time just to learn to catch and throw the ball. A summer? A season? 4th grade? 4th, 5th, and 6ths grade? High school? 7 years? What about a few more - for college? What about 10 years? and then what are the chances that you'll be great? Only a 0.5% chance you'll even *play*.

So - **why** would anyone expect *anything else* to take only a few hours here and there watching some YouTube videos? Better get real. We absolutely *need* **you** to be real.  


By spending hundreds - if not thousands of hours watching videos - and passively *taking* online courses... and dragging it out (sometimes for years) - you are creating a false reality. You aren't learning. You are just ""feeling"" like you are learning. You're brainwashing yourself.  


I've worked with hundreds of boot camp graduates who feel on top of the world... but when it comes to the basics, it turns out they just do NOT ""*get it*.""

Be careful how you spend your time. Your posts/questions are all documented. We can easily track it back - and it's terrifying how many people have been ""learning"" for - 3-4 years --- and can't create a basic website (of quality). The recruiters can see your history too.

Consider either going all in - and really learning it properly - - - or switching your focus to something else. You probably just don't really like programming, if you aren't getting ahead."

https://preview.redd.it/hlml1bbqmni71.png?width=1194&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba5b0bce253081353a2ec2e00473e024df9bcfa2

\*\*LinkedIn isn't a reliable source of grads so interpret this data lightly. Some grads don't join the LinkedIn system and mostly the alumni list only shows up to 15 tech companies for each boot camp, so I'm missing a few grads from other high tier companies but by only a teeny amount  
\*\*General Assembly fills a lot of companies due to its HUGE alumni pool (ex: for Google, .7% of GA's total alumni are there vs 1.5% of Hack Reactor's total alumni)  
\-implying a huge majority of their grads are more unemployed than you think (suggesting those grads with jobs either had lots of experience/school beforehand or were connected to a special program such as the General Assembly x Digital Academy and don't represent the majority with no experience)

\*Good tech companies only hire 1.5-7% from each boot camp. This is depressing news for us and implying boot camps are actually a scam for most people that have no experience or are not a woman/of color/sociable. So those outcome reports boasting &gt;80% of grads getting tech jobs are based on fraudulent cherrypicked sampling or are in startups, freelancing, or health care which the majority of applicants don't want. Joining a boot camp is basically throwing your money away unless you have a good education, connections, or hella good/lucky which is really rare.  


\*for **UX**, go to General Assembly or Springboard  
\*for **web**, go to Hack Reactor or App Academy (maybe Coding Dojo, they're good for Amazon and Microsoft but terrible for everywhere else)  
\*for **data**, idk sigh. General Assembly or Springboard?  
\*for **cybersecurity**, go to Flatiron  
\*Coding Dojo isn't as good as I hoped despite their heavy marketing  
\*avoid 4 out of 10 boot camps: Nucamp, Thinkful, Iron Hack, Devmountain (less funding=bankruptcy)  
\-Nucamp grads that are working in Tesla and Verizon either have masters/PhDs or connections  
\*Devmountain is hilarious, just scroll down"

codingbootcamp,Help evaluating a coding mentorship program,1629491863,"I joined a meetup started by an instructor at UCLA who runs this  mentorship program as a side business and wanted to know how it compares to other paid ways to learn coding.

The learning style, from what I've sat through so far are collaborative 'classes' of people at various levels of skill who are working through their own assignments but bring up any questions  they may have with the class as they progress; very similar to coding events you see through Meetup except there is a person (the instructor) who is paid to be there to help you along.

This format seems to be a better fit for me than the self-directed assignment based courses you find at various websites since while I am genuinely interested in trying to pick up coding and develop a solid foundation in CS, I tend to lack the discipline needed to push forward with things when left to my own devices and the freewheeling style of most of the coding meetups I've been to does not mesh well with that.

As for the specifics, the program is $550/month which buys me access to three 2-3 hour supervised coding sessions per week (with the potential for more sessions if classes grow large enough to justify it). Class attendance is 'gym style' meaning I set the pace by attending the sessions at my pleasure though he says that he will get on your case if he feels like you are slacking off and not attending as many sessions as he thinks you should (though at $550/month I find myself unlikely to take it for granted!)

At an average of three sessions per week he is claiming he can give me enough of a foundation to be a competitive applicant at most tech jobs in two years and has done this long enough (since 2015) to have graduated students who went on to find jobs in tech to show for it.

This compares favorably to UCLA's bootcamp which charges around $12000-13000 for a 24 week part-time (12 week full time) and after mentioning this to him he claims that, as one of the more popular instructors, UCLA actually approached him about developing the bootcamp for them but he ultimately turned it down because he didn't think their timelines were realistic and didn't want to just churn out students who wouldn't be able to meet his standard for competency in coding.

From what I can tell through Google, everything I've found about him seems legit, and while he seemed a little aggressive with his pitch at times (understandable as his business took a hit from the pandemic like everyone else), my conversations with him sounded genuine, raised no obvious red flags, and it didn't feel like there was anything shady going on.

Hi everyone!

I'm new to Reddit, so I apologize if I'm not posting this question in the right subreddit or if I misuse the platform on my first try -- please feel free to give me your feedback!

I'm a former coding bootcamp student who's been working as a full-time dev for a little under 2 years now, making a good living and enjoying my life &amp; work. I've been getting a \*lot\* of unsolicited questions from other bootcamp grads asking me how I landed my job and if I could provide them with tips &amp; such. After a while I thought I could turn this into a small side project because I really enjoy the process of helping others, making new connections and generally seeing people get their money's worth. I put together a small platform that offers career coaching / job hunting tips specific to bootcamp grads.

Before I dedicate more time, I was curious to see if there's general interest among other grads in something like this? It's not revolutionary, I know. It's really just career coaching, but it draws a lot on my successful attempts of securing 3 different offers.

Share your honest thoughts! Thank you everyone. Stay safe

PS. I'm not linking/naming my website here b/c I don't want to just self-promote. I'm legitimately just trying to hear your thoughts about if this is something anyone would be interested in. Thanks again!"

codingbootcamp,"""Is CS college or a boot camp worth it?"" Get out your comparison operators ...",1629232621,"&gt;Is it worth it? Should I do X? Would Y be good for me?

No one can decide what it's ""worth"" to you. If you've ever listened to a podcast like Freakanomics - you've probably called this idea of *worth* into question. Is the hamburger worth it? Well, only if you'd rather *eat it* than your continue to *have* your ten dollars. 

**You** will decide. The reality of that choice will vary. I went to an expensive art school. Was it ""worth it?"" I think it turned out OK. I didn't try and figure out THE BEST SCHOOL EVER. I just did what most kids seem to do. They just do what their parents say - and take whatever opportunity presents itself.

But when you're talking about something more complex than a hamburger, it's not just a gut reaction. It doesn't matter what other people think is worth it. These types of things aren't typical commodities.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Is **it** *worth* **it**?

### What are the ""ITS"" ? Is WHAT worth - WHAT?

Is college worth it? Well, what is the VALUE? What could (*this very abstract idea of college*) education bring into your life? What will you have to give up, change, and hand over in exchange?

Is spending 2-6 years self-teaching through a ton of free online courses worth it? Are we talking about money - or time? What is the real *price*? 

If you are asking ***strangers*** (*on the internet*) questions like: ""Is going to computer science school worth it?"" or ""should I go to a coding boot camp?""  then you don't know enough about the *value* of those things *yet*. You aren't operating with a real connection to the subject. And the people you are asking don't know enough about *you* to give you a useful answer - for your unique context.

By nature - there will be buyer's remorse. People will puff up their experience. After all - they know everything about *all* schools - because they went to 1 of them.

It appears people are instead fishing for a *sure thing*.

&gt;If I choose this path - can you promise me that I'll have no regrets?  
&gt;  

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;Can you promise me that I'll get way more in return than what I put out?

&amp;nbsp;

**No**. You'll have to learn much more about it - and choose for yourself. If you've got real questions - that are unique to your unique goals and your unique backstories - then maybe you're ready to have a conversation that is ""worth it."""

Everything they teach you is online from free resources so just use them instead. I had a great instructor in my program though but the lack of no exercises or material to practice or learn from made this coding bootcamp a complete waste of time. 

When 75% of my classmates dropped out after the first week should of been a clue. Cohort went from 60+ down to 18. I withdrew after 2 weeks of classes my daughter had Healthcare emergency and they wouldn't let me not pay the rest I was self funding by using a credit card.

First I know they have an arbitrary requirement for a Macbook, has anyone been able to get a waiver for this? My reasons? I did the Galvanize Data Science Immersive last summer for which I bought a System 76 computer that runs the Linux Distribution, Ubuntu (Mac is essentially Linux, just a different flavor than Ubuntu), I already have all the required packages via Anaconda (I dl'd it for the Galvanize program), and in the year plus I have been working with Linux I have not had a problem that I couldn't resolve. Those problems were primarily around dl'ing packages for Anaconda which resulted in either running in Docker, a virtual conda environment, or doing pip install. To me, it feels as though my experience invalidates their reasons for needing one. Additionally, I have been unemployed for a while and can not afford one nor will I be taking out a loan to afford one.

Next, I am currently on the West Coast and need some help figuring out an affordable place to live. I will have housing allowance and do have some money saved up, but due to the duration of my unemployment and VET TEC doesn't start giving housing until a month in (each month the verify your attendance, which pushes back the housing payment) I will be kind of strapped for cash until October. I am also weary about using Craigslist without seeing the place, but choosing an apartment complex might required some more financial stability. My ideal location is within walking distance to the school, but am willing to move further if I can find a gym without walking distance. Basically I would prefer the things I do every day to be within walking distance, so school and gym. I really like the Maverick building and I saw some great studios, but not sure their move-in, leasing options, and up-front payments will work.

I sincerely appreciate any help.

I have prior experience teaching myself programming and I'm familiar with OOP. I want java bootcamp so I can learn modern frameworks and proper practices...and so I'll be more marketable with that on my resume, w/o a CS degree.

So I'm not dumb. My free IQ test scores are high (lol promise I'm joking). But, I do have ADD. So I have trouble focusing and therefore reading...which means I take a bit longer to process info I'm taking in.

I previously applied for a job with paid bootcamp. I was 2 pts from passing their aptitude test. Basically panicked during the test, which only made my focus worse. They made an exception when I explained my learning disability, but I've always wondered if it was for HR/PR non-discrimination reasons, knowing they could just reject me in the final stages.

Should I disclose a learning disability before the aptitude test this time? Or will it only end up hurting me? It's very hard to prove discrimination but it happens and I can understand why. 

Please, any advice welcome. I really like programming and desperately want a job. Bootcamp is probably my last hope at my dream job, so I need to know how to not mess it up."

These are the schools I narrowed down to:

1. Codeworks
2. WBS
3. Ironhack
4. Wild Code

My priorities for choosing a bootcamp are:

1. Curriculum (I think the above 4 coding schools offer similar syllabus which focus on demanding languages) 
2. Instructors (I read some reviews about coding schools nowsaday are filled with own graduates instead of real-world experienced programmers which holds me back from deciding)
3. Career service such as job fair with partnered hiring company  (So far I've only seen credited outcome report from Ironhack but it was back in 2019 and never since updated, things can changed alot in 2 years especially during a pandemic. I also see 100% hired on Codeworks website, how true is it?)
4. Events such as tech talks, company expect sharing etc to build connection and get to know the real programming world (not so important but is a big plus point if there is)

When i was young and still in school, my teacher / parents like to always say that if you can't explain something mean you don't even know what it is.

I did the first interview already which went well, plus I passed the online assessment already which basically means I'm in. The admission process was pretty easy tbh. What's really holding me back from committing is the online mixed reviews and the money.

Just to give everyone more background context about me, I'm already working in the IT field. I graduated college just a few years back and have been doing help desk related positions since. A few of the topics in the syllabus I'm already familiar with to a certain extent. The reason I took an interest in this particular bootcamp is for the opportunity to advance in my career, learn new skillsets, and have the Colombia certificate added to my resume.

If there's anyone in this thread that has already gone through the bootcamp and could give any advice, I would really appreciate it! Thanks."

I finally saved up for a bootcamp, and planned on doing Hack Reactor. I have my entry assessment in less than 2 weeks, and I now feel incredibly unprepared. I thought I was good until I saw their material and turns out they test on a bunch of stuff I hadn’t learned yet. 

It just feels like every time I get close to finally doing a bootcamp life throws something at me except this last time it’s entirely my fault for being underprepared and not knowing about testing suites. How did you guys navigate the obstacles that presented themselves during your bootcamp journeys? Should I just do an easier bootcamp? Give up the journey altogether?

Currently working part time in the mornings approx 30ish hours a week. The rest is working remotely via mortgage which is extremely flexible. I’m no stranger to self paced online courses and I was open to this even if it meant committing another 30-40 hours a week. I’m not opposed to paid courses if they will make myself more marketable. Also willing to start free courses as soon as tomorrow. My goal is to be marketable in six months to a year.

codingbootcamp,Anyone here went through hackreactor with no background in CS/prior coding experience?,1627407969,"So I'm wanting to get into a coding Bootcamp and thought I narrowed my search to Hack Reactor, but I'm starting to second guess myself. I've been doing their self-prep and it's been going ok some of the challenges have been harder than others but with absolutely taking my time I've managed to get to module 2 in about 3 weeks at 3hrs of study per day probably could have made it 2 (I work full time and I'm usually tired by the end of the day which causes me to take longer to solve problems I think a rested mind would be able to solve sooner). This was just to provide some context.  


My main question to anyone who attended (without a CS background or programming experience) and was successful is how much time before Bootcamp did you need to prep? I'm considering the November cohort which would effectively give me a total of 4 months (inclusive of July) to prep. Is this enough time to get prepared to handle the Bootcamp? I currently do around 3hrs per day 7 days a week but plan on leaving my current job at the end of August and should be able to spend September and October studying for 8hrs or so a day or hopefully more.  


Is this a program I should attempt based on the time restraints listed? or should I simply aim for a less rigorous program or push out my start date by a couple of months? I'm interested in all responses. I've noticed a definite trend of the ones finding desirable outcomes are typically those who spent a significant amount of time preparing and self-teaching before deciding on a Bootcamp. As far as further background details, I do have a STEM bachelor's degree but it's been of no significance to the material being learned thus far."

codingbootcamp,Questions about bootcamps,1627052085,"TL;DR
Is my associates degree in Electronic Engineering Technology going to help me or hurt me in the job hunt?

If self taught devs can find jobs, is the bootcamp a bonus? 


1) self taught vs bootcamp.
I see a lot of people advocate for going the self taught route for various reasons. ****My question is, if someone who is self taught(no degree/irrelevant degree/similar degree) can find a job, does adding a bootcamp to your resume increase the odds? ****

2) I see a lot of employers ask for a degree of some kind if they even ask for one at all. "" bscs or related"", "" bachelors computer science or engineering"" , etc.

I have an associates degree in electronic engineering technology. 
****Would this help me, or hurt me in the job hunt after bootcamp?***
My degree covered the usual gen eds, calculus, physics, 2 programming courses(Java, assembly) as well as electrical theory and circuits. 

I know it's matter of how much effort the individual puts into their education and job search that counts the most. I'm well aware and prepared to go beyond what's expected to set myself apart. Also, I find coding to be very enjoyable and the creativity involved with web dev is something I could do for the rest of my life. 

I'm worried that bootcamp grads who are successful only make it because they have a previous degree to help them. Even if it's completely irrelevant it's like it tells an employer that this person was devoted enough to complete their undergraduate. Am I wrong to believe this? 

Personally I think it will help, it's in the realm of technology and the programming courses were part of the core education requirements. 
 
Thank you for your time if you read this far. I'm strongly considering a career change and cautious about what I need to do to make it happen."

codingbootcamp,How rare is it to land a first job as a remote job?,1626908861,"TLDR:  I am considering doing some self study and then doing a coding bootcamp in Mexico City.  I don't have much, if any, desire to live in the USA anytime soon (although American).  I want to continue living remote...but I seem to hear that you need a lot of experience before employers consider you for remote programming opportunities.  Is this true?  


&amp;#x200B;

About me:

I went from an Economics B.S...to HR/management for retail businesses for 2 years post college before saying screw living in the USA and moving abroad to teach english.  I've been doing it abroad for the past few years as well as doing some mixed work for a startup (marketing, sales, writing) etc.  Trouble is the startup is a paltry salary of about $10 an hour...but I took it because I thought it would be good to get some legit experience on my resume after years traveling the world.

I am very motivated this year to completely ditch the english teaching, start traveling less, and pursue something with more long term viability.

My friend has been suggesting a bootcamp in Mexico City (currently nomading and cost of living would be do-able)

I realize I wouldn't be making a ton right off the bat....but it would certainly be superior to my current \~24,000k income I am making and make me much more secure in my future and boost my confidence a ton...which is honestly a bit lacking with the whole online teacher schtick.

What are your thoughts? Thank you."

codingbootcamp,"Questions about Codesmith specifically, and bootcamps in general.",1626880700,"I recently started looking at bootcamps and I have Codesmith as my top choice. 

I am wondering if there is an unspoken thing in bootcamps where age is a determining factor. I will be turning 36 in March, and I know little to nothing about programming. I am currently slowly working through Colt Steele’s Web Development bootcamp, but I think I would function better in an in-person, structured setting. Plus, I would prefer to do software engineering, and not just web development. 

Is this something that might turn off bootcamps, specifically Codesmith? I also have very little work explored because of a disability, but the reason I am considering the bootcamp at this time is because I feel I am at a point where I can really manage my disability and work functionally. 

Would my age and/or lack of work experience be taken into account by bootcamps?

I guess what I am asking is about the culture of bootcamps? Okay, this sounds silly, but no one is going to come out and say Hollywood is agist or sexist, but we all know people of a certain age and gender are looked over. I’m wondering if bootcamp insiders know if the technology field is the same way. 

Also, if there are other ways besides bootcamps, where I could learn to become a successful software engineer, I would appreciate any tips or ideas.

The instructors are great, very knowledgeable and almost always available to help. Every Thursday is a tech talk with a potential employer, so you get to build a network over the course. The placement team comes in throughout the course, and help prepare you for the interview progress. Weekly surveys actually mean something. They accept the feedback and adjust. We had an issue with one of our professors, and mentioned it in the surveys but the higher ups addressed it swiftly. If you have any questions about the program I will do my best to help, but they definitely have my recommendation so far."

codingbootcamp,4 JavaScript Projects To Build FAST And Get Hired In 1 Month,1626282478,"If you're starting to apply for your first web developer junior position, then you might want to consider building out one of the 4 (if not all) projects.

**Why?** The projects were thought out based on daily tasks that many web developers (including seniors) face every day.

***1. Consume API (Backend)***

When you consume someone else's API, you are talking to a third party outside of your system. You could choose what type of data you want to get, should you validate it, how do you want to store it in your database, etc.

This is where you could throw in your imagination and do whatever you want with the data. You could also perform a small CRUD system once you've retrieved the data.

To give you an idea, you could consume Yelp or SpaceX API (but there is a lot more out there):

SpaceX API [https://docs.spacexdata.com/](https://docs.spacexdata.com/)

Yelp API [https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get\_started](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started)

***2. 10 Hour Challenge (Frontend)***

This is my personal favorite if you're planning to be a front-end developer.

Within 10 hours, you should build a single-page application using a framework that you've never used before. It has to be responsive, look good/decent, and deployed onto a hosting service.

Having something like on the resume will impress every person on the interview as you will demonstrate how fast you can learn, implement, and not get destructed in the process. But again, the key is to finish it in 10 hours.

***3. Building Blog Post (Frontend, Backend)***

You've probably heard this already, but there is one key element that many developers don't implement.

When we build projects with X number of records on a single page, we follow a specific process that allows us to load a specific number of records instead of loading all records at once. This process is called **pagination**.

If you were to go on: amazon -&gt; search for any product -&gt; scroll down till you see page numbers -&gt; 1,2,3,... x

Well, that is pagination! So when you are building out a blog page, you're focusing on implementation the pagination functionality.

Suppose you don't have a blog, no problem. You could talk to Yelp API or the database that you've built for the first project.

***4. Hotel System (Frontend, Backend)***

This one will be a bit more complex and time-consuming as you will be building out the frontend, backend, database, and most importantly, building out the features.

Every hotel has a specific number of available rooms, included in the packages (this is up to your imagination), for how long the guest will be staying, and a lot more.

Don't go overboard and build out the Hilten system, but focus on maybe 3 to 4 features that you know could be fun to demonstrate during the interview and do small calculations.

These are the four projects that could help you stand out during the interview and help you to land a job much faster than you think. You may not even get a coding challenge because you will demonstrate excellent work (that's what happened to me).

codingbootcamp,App Academy review,1625797475,"Throwaway account. 

I attended the online bootcamp, the 24 week program. I am currently working in the tech field and got my job in about 5 months after graduation.

Let me start by dispelling some myths. No, graduates do not make on average 6 figures after graduation. That number is attributed mainly the the SF NY area, where the buying power of 100k is about 60-70k anywhere else (which happens to be what grads outside of those areas end up making). So if you think you'll be rich after graduation, get that thought out of your head. Of course there is the rare breed that gets into FAANG, but lets keep it real and assume you're average, which is perfectly fine. They also like to say they have a 3% acceptance rate, but I get the suspicion that figure probably includes people who applied and then changed their minds. If they were talking about the rate of people who were accepted after the first soft interview, its probably higher than 30%, but im just spitballing here. 

Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the actual program. It is TOUGH, and they are not lying when they say you need at least 60-80 hours a week of studying to follow along. Of course if you come from a CS background it might be less, but the majority of people who attend these bootcamps do not know anything about coding. It truly is a college degree equivalent, and I can say that with certainty since I came into my job with more knowledge than some of these fresh CS degrees. The thing about college is that while you get more time to study the concepts and go more in depth on certain topics, you end up not coding often enough to actually know what you're supposed to do at your first job, whereas aA is 100% of the time coding and simulates a development environment rather well. On the flipside, college grads had more knowledge on the non coding aspects of the job while I had to learn it as I went. 

They focus entirely on web development since web development jobs are the easiest to get, and also the most popular kind of development job. You'll learn all the latest and greatest languages and frameworks, Python and JavaScript being the two biggest since they're the most common in web development. The first 2 months or so are dedicated to learning the basics of development such as data types, booleans, APIs, class and OOP, etc. The next 4 months are focused on learning frameworks and actual development. Their curriculum is constantly evolving which is something I commend them for, but they also have some massive flaws such as waiting until 2/3rds of the way into the course before teaching Python. The logic is that Python is a lot easier to grasp the core concepts of than the trashpile language that is JS and I can understand that, but Python is more popular and is more often used in actual code so take that as you will. 

You will be coding 3-4 websites to add to your portfolio in order to use on the job hunt, but it's not going to be enough. You're competing with thousands of other people who will have a similar amount of projects, and an advantage of having internships which is something you wont have. A lot of these projects are kind of amazing though if you consider that we had a week to do it. People seem to like to use the Google Maps API and AWS to give their features that extra oomph, and MaterialUi and Bootstrap for the frontend. Attend some hackathons or make more projects after grad to stand out. 

The rate of people who fail out of the camp isn't that high, at least not when I took it. People need to pass an assessment every week. If they get below an 80% they get sent back 4 weeks to repeat, and you get 3 chances to do this. The assessments are usually not that hard, although there are some extreme difficulty spikes such as the React assessment that took about 3 hours, but we had about 3 days to learn about useState, useEffect, useContext, and Redux for good measure. And you'll also see the occasional idiot who is obviously cheating through their assessments until they hit one where they can't cheat on since its all coding and no multiple choice/ short answer. Those kinds of people are dumb as hell, since they're just wasting their or their parent's money. But I digress. 


Speaking of money, lets talk money. You have two options, pay upfront for about 22k, or pay after you get a job and pay them 15% of your salary every year for 3 years, capped at certain brackets, so you'll pay 12-15% depending on where you are. Is it worth the money? Thats hard to say. It depends on what you are willing to pay for college. If you're willing to pay more, take this program. If you dont think college is worth that much, dont take this program. Because it really is a college degree equivalent in terms of practical knowledge, so price it as such. You're also paying for their extensive alumni network, which is a real boon when you're job hunting. 

In summary, this program is not going to get you rich quick. It's essentially shoving 4 years of college experience into your head in about 1/8th of the time. And like any other college grad you'll need to hustle to get that first job. All this program does is prepare you to start your career in development. The pros and cons of aA vs a traditional college is that you'll get more hands on coding experience, but have less time to understand it all. But thats the nature of development, you'll constantly be learning new technologies and what you know now will be obsolete in 2 years, and a bootcamp experience isnt all that different. aA is a perfectly valid way to get your career started in tech, but at the end of the day its all up to you to get your dream job."

codingbootcamp,Need advice on monitor setup,1625278221,Hey everyone! I’ve been learning how to code here and there and will be joining a bootcamp real soon. Bootcamp usually recommends having a monitor of at least 27 inches or a dual monitor setup. My options are to get myself the newest M1 iMac and work side to side with my 2015 MacBook Pro (if needed) or buy an M1 Mac Mini with some kind of ultrawide monitor. Both options seem to be the same in terms of price range but I wasn’t sure if I should choose the M1 Mac mini with an ultrawide monitor over the M1 iMac’s 24”. What would you go for?
codingbootcamp,Looking for advice on a few online bootcamps,1625277222,"I've been looking every so often for a few months on several different websites and search engines, skimming reviews, looking at websites/curriculum, YouTube testimonials, etc. I don't live in a metropolitan area, so I don't really have the option to attend one physically. Software Engineering has been something I have been interested in since I was 6 (I'm 25, almost 26 now) and I went to college for CS but had to drop out just after earning my Associate's to work full time, so I have some limited experience in HTML, CSS, C#. I'm really ready to buckle down and just jump right into the deep end with an immersive program. I just want to make sure I join a program that will really prepare me for a job as a software engineer as soon as possible.

I've narrowed it down to CodeSmith, Flatiron, and Thinkful. They're all in the 15-20k price range, all an average of 4-6 months, and have very similar curriculum (though, at least from their website, it does appear CodeSmith goes over quite a bit more). Does anyone have any recommendations for one of these programs or even one I haven't listed? I would really appreciate the advice."

If I had a few friends with the same goal it would have been a lot more interesting and easy to learn. Like giving each other tasks/challenges, etc. to make it interesting.

codingbootcamp,Do I have what it takes to do coding for living?,1625226455,"I am looking for boost of my confidence, and genuine advice but only by your honest answers. I will try to describe myself as good as can and I would like to know if this sounds for you enough to become a professional programmer.

Education: It technician graduated in 2010 in Poland. + 1 year of university of computer science (3,5 year engineering studies which I quit after 1 year) as it comes to coding, I got only to very low level in c++, and Turbo Pascal. I could write programs that counts how much paint you need for flat in provided dimensions. Etc. Never done anything with graphic interface.
Work experience: In 2012 I went to England and I worked in security, mostly body guarding and high end clubs/casinos/5star hotels. The only job I needed partly to spend in the office was supervisor position in big security company, but I needed to use only excel/word/timegate.

In autumn 2019 with wife and 2 kids I ""earned"" in London I moved to Barcelona Spain, after 6 months in which I studied Spanish, I try to validate my security licenses, we spent our life time earnings on flat and refurbishment and... Pandemy came. Work market is unbelievably tight here, bodyguards network is completely unaccessible, and other security Jobs( even if I validate my licenses) doesn't give more than 1300 euros a month. Eventually I got stuck working on the doors in a clothing store for 1000 euro a month. That's when I start thinking about coding...

I attended professional iq test ( in psychological clinic) in the age of 10 and 20. First score was 142, and next one 126. Doctor explained me that it droped down in a part of social skills, which are 0/20 but I'm 18-20/20 in 3d thinking, predicting skills, logic, and mathematical thinking.
Any work I did I was always considered the best worker or among the best, I believe it's due to dedication and really hard working mind set.

I can not go to university bcuz I'm working 11-21h, and I will lose my apartment if I can't pay the bills( I'm on the edge) but I can dedicate rest of my time on self learning (15-20 hours a week). Overall my best side is true dedication and always trying my best. my worst are social skills, I don't know if it's ok to ask for help and where?

Do you guys think it's possible to get paid job or internship after completing some free courses of coding? How it could be done
I'm 31 ATM.

codingbootcamp,Why do I use Docker?,1624735693,"Before I talk about Docker, let me give you a common problem in software development that developers used to have.

Let’s say a developer who just finished developing and testing a new feature worked fine on their environment. But when the same code reached production, suddenly, the system crashed. One of the possible reasons is that the development and production environments are different from each other.

Before Docker, developers would use Virtual Machine to create a virtual environment to ensure that the developer’s station matches the production server. The problem with that is now we are wasting resources and not able to usefully our Disk Space, Memory, Processing Power, and more.

Docker is different to set it up and use. It is installed directly onto the user’s machine, and developers can install multiple containers responsible for their microservice. As you can see, we didn’t have to allocate any of the resources for our containers, and it will automatically use what it needs for the need of an application.

We can now have our code base with all the tools running equally on any environment with that setup.

In conclusion, if you were to start to work on the project, I would recommend using Docker as it will remove the environmental issues.

September, in thinking of trying to go to a bootcamp, but I'm not sure if it would be better to get a college certificate? I could take two more classes for the certificate at my local college. I'd like to get into android development, I've taken a C class and have learned a bit of JavaScript and python on the side.

I don't really have the funds for a bootcamp either way, so I'd need to find one at lower cost or one of the ones that takes some of your pay when you're hired.

I guess my question is, if I get a certificate and make a few apps, would that be enough to get a entry level job, compared to a bootcamp? What would hiring managers actually care about credential wise?

codingbootcamp,I am 5 weeks away from a 1 year coding academy/bootcamp. My brain feels like mush and I don't think I am good enough to look for an entry-level web developing job. What should I do to help get myself back on track to landing my first entry-level web developer job?,1624590859,"I \[24F\] will be finishing up a full-stack coding academy in late July. I thought I would be on top of my programming skills by now, but I feel that I am far from it.

My program is a non-profit and didn't really have a syllabus to follow. From this academy, I learned C#, HTML, CSS, some Javascript, and just ""finished"" learning about SQL about a week ago. 

I thought we would be doing passion projects by now, but we're still doing random projects. Out of the 9 of us, 2 have already found jobs and stopped the program. 2 others that are still in the group are just basically here to kill time and don't intend on finding a tech job right away. The rest of us are still putting effort into the program until we either find tech jobs or until the program is over.

At the very beginning, I was bright and really determined. I guess part of that was because I was admitted 2 weeks later than everybody else and didn't get to be with the other classmates until 5 months later. I was adamant in catching up with the others, but that never really happened. What happened was that I was doing  great with the work I was given and then they had me skip projects/lessons that everyone else got to do but not me. When they made me do the same kind of projects that everyone else did, I started to feel bad and incompetent. It didn't help that we were just everywhere (coding wise) and then a few big things happened that would derail our schedule.

When they made that switch, I started to code just to survive instead of really taking the time for me to learn and to do things on my own. I would hire tutors to help me get through projects. Once the projects were over, I would get a temporary relief until the next fancy project started. 

Now, whenever a project is being assigned to us, my head just feel like mush and I don't seem to code as well as the others on my own. I feel like a failure. I just want the academy to end already since I am no longer feeling competent in coding.

This program is broad in the sense of ""let's try everything, even though it wasn't in the schedule and have never done this before."" 

We went so far as to randomly pick up Ruby on Rails (RoR) because there was an internship opening, but our instructor didn't know anything about RoR. So they had us follow along a video to learn about RoR and told us to incorporate all these things that we would have to find out ourselves. If we had a problem, we couldn't ask anyone except fellow classmates for help. I'm not upset that we had to learn a little about RoR, but it was the fact that it was so random that the scheduled learning about SQL had to take a backseat for almost an entire month just to never really use or understand more about RoR.

I even have a project right now that I didn't make great progress with since I didn't have a tutor to help me. It's due Monday, but my head is just not in the right place and I know it takes a lot more time than others to get things done. I can't seem to really bring myself to do this project and I don't think I could finish this one in time. This would be the first time that I missed a deadline.

I really feel incompetent.

I know that I want to be web developer, most likely front end. I also want to learn about App Development, but I know the academy would never cover it. I am great with HTML and CSS. I'm working on cleaning up my Javascript skills. Other than these three things, I don't know where to go from here. I'm thinking about doing the free code camp website to do a brush up and to make myself feel confident again, but I don't know what else to study.

Can someone give me any word of wisdom about how I am feeling? Can someone give me a roadmap or point me in the direction that I need to learn before setting out for web developing jobs? Would this feeling of being inadequate ever go away in time for me to land my first tech job? What should I expect a web developer job interview to be like? We did mock interviews, but it was only one time and it was for an area that I just wasn't comfortable with."

codingbootcamp,Nucamp,1623825183,"I'm here to give you guys my thoughts on the Nucamp bootcamp. For anyone wondering this bootcamp is strictly ONLINE. I have took the Web development fundamental course and the Full Stack course.

**The Curriculum**

They give you a set amount of videos and topics you get to watch during the week ( Pretty useful and they explain it as simply as possible yet it is pretty boring )

You have Saturday classes on Zoom which consist of pair programming and reviewing pretty much what you learned during the week, they are about 4-5 hours long.

You guys get to work on your portfolio as you go along which helps you in the job search.

They give you projects to do to put on your portfolio which we do every 4-5 weeks .

The instructors are changed every 4-5 weeks as you go along with the course (which is helpful since having the same instructor would just question the person's ability and expertise)

**My Experience**

I would fairly say my experience was good. It was worth the price since I had some pocket change left on me. You get what you paid for pretty much. Learning front and back end in 22 weeks with projects and a portfolio ready for you was worth it. The instructors were good yet one of them was a CS graduate and another a Nucamp bootcamp graduate. They had the knowledge and explained everything well so it turned out good. I could say that I came out there with a great amount of knowledge and able to build websites and the backend as well. I would say tho , my websites aren't as pleasing as everyone thinks they would be. They aren't TOP TIER websites with super great designs, I only learned pretty much to build a GOOD website, thats it. It did help me tho giving me the proper knowledge on everything I needed to know.

**Overall** 

It is worth it in my opinion if you really want that mentorship type of feel in this bootcamp and pair programming as well. But I could of easily learned all of this in a free resource website such as Codeacdemy , udemy, teamtreehouse ect. The price is decent tho compared to other bootcamps so don't expect to be some senior developer that just finished a bootcamp and is job ready. You may be able to land a junior level position if you really put some effort in the bootcamp and make your own websites.  The job assistance was okay not anything great. They helped me with my resume and Linkedin . I'm currently still looking for a job (1 month post grad) but have gotten 2 interviews so far."

I've almost certainly made up my mind that I want to join an online, part-time, full-stack, coding bootcamp, but after a lot of research and info sessions (and a detailed pros/cons spreadsheet:)) I've narrowed it down to two. Prime Digital Academy &amp; General Assembly.

I've looked at Course Report and other online reviews but thought I'd throw the question out here to see if anyone else has any thoughts on these two. Maybe you attended one of these, or almost attended and went for another. I'd be really interested to hear what people thought of it after attending the bootcamp, and to an equal degree, why you didn't choose one/either of these if you were at one point considering them.

They both cost about the same $$ and offer a similar curriculum, although I think General Assembly might contain more face time with the instructors and total classroom instruction. Also the curriculum has a bit more detail on algorithms and data structures.

I'd be interested to hear if people think one is regarded more highly by employers, or if they just think bootcamps are all the same. I live in the Twin Cities (the home of Prime Academy) but with remote work more prevalent, I wouldn't be limiting my search to local companies.

Any thoughts on these two programs would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, MattBies"

codingbootcamp,Swift/iOS development boot camp or path?,1623786588,"I’ve been considering leaving my established career in marketing to do a full-stack boot camp and become a developer. I love coding and have limited experience with HTML, CSS, and 1/3 of the Dr. Angela Yu Swift course I took (and loved) when I was out of work for a few weeks last year. 

What I’d ultimately like to do is create apps on my own or with partners—I design and write already, and would love to apply all these skills into one focused outcome. 

• With little-to-no free time afforded at my current job, and no freedom to up and quit without reasonably good odds of landing a dev gig within a year, what’s the best path to becoming a Swift developer?

• Are there dedicated boot camps for iOS development that have good reputations/outcomes? 

• Alternately, does it make sense to learn full-stack, start down any dev career path and eventually learn/transition to Swift? Would that benefit me more than a singular focus on Swift/iOS?

Would love to hear thoughts/experiences. I’m familiar with several of the popular self-guided Swift resources including Hacking With Swift, and have learned a bit from those already as well. Would like to throw myself into the game fully and love a classroom environment (likely remote). Thanks!"

I've been trying to learn C# in my spare time, but I work looney hours and I've got parental duty when I'm not so I haven't been retaining a damn thing. I wanted to avoid paying when I could learn for free, but free and viable are a planetary alignment that I'm done waiting for.

First question, is my little laptop up to the task? Processor is Intel Core i3 and it's got 4GB of RAM. I have 100Mbps wifi at home. Sounds fine to my inexperienced self, but I'd like to prevent shelling out the money, taking the time off work, and then pulling all my hair out as my hardware fails to keep up with the class.

Second, I would not be able to work my current job (local semi driver) and take on your regular 14 week bootcamp + parenting, so I've been trying to figure out an option that involves more than sitting on my hands and gazing wistfully at the impossibilities.

I have a little bg in HTML from the ol MySpace days, and a friend of mine that has been coding for 20+ years says a little HTML xp can get a few small gigs if I bullshit my way in.

codingbootcamp,Advice: Know when to give your brain a breather and take a break.,1622894885,"I completed General Assembly a few weeks ago.  I still can't believe how much I learned and did in only 12 weeks and if I'm being really honest, by the end I had a lot of issues with imposter syndrome and confidence.  I felt like my final project was hardly my best work and had a lot of trouble dragging myself to be productive.  Once it was over I took a little over a week away from the computer to emotionally detox and just let everything reset.  I spent time eating healthier, reading (you know, books), and sleeping normally.  Started going to the gym again too, and just getting back into better living habits.

About 10 days ago I picked up coding again and seriously, it's absolutely night and day to compare my work now vs my work the final project week.  I've had concussions before, and the final week of GA I literally felt the same brain fog as the worst concussion I've had.  Like, I'd pop open Notion to read something and after 30 seconds I'd realize I wasn't reading... just scrolling up and down aimlessly.  But now?  I can pop open an old project I want to clean up, spend 15 minutes looking at the code, and both remember how everything works while saying ""wow... this is trash"".  And then happily and productively spend a day or two improving my projects so they're coded better, neater, and have a nicer front-end.  I'm amazed by what I'm doing and getting done.  Right now I'm self-teaching Gatsby to build a 2.0 of my website (currently its static HTML/CSS) and I seriously feel my brain just soaking up information.

Seriously, burn-out is real and if you want to be successful, prioritize self-care and time away from the screen to relax and recharge.  It's worth it."

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp grad who just accepted an offer 6 weeks after graduating. Happy to answer any questions for anyone looking for honest info about the experience.,1622827264,"I wanted to post this because when I was deciding whether to go to a bootcamp or not I felt like there either weren’t a lot of posts from people who actually attended and graduated (lots from folks deciding or just getting accepted) and that generally people were against bootcamp in favor of self learning. I was in that same boat and decided to go for it and wanted to share my experience. Feel free to ask any questions! 

Below is just some context about my journey - definitely not required reading. 

My background
My background prior to enrolling in the bootcamp was an undergrad degree in poli-sci and a single intro to CS class in python. Post college I spent a couple years doing code academy classes in python, html, css, and sql (MySQL I think) but honestly I didn’t know what to do with anything I was learning and there were huge gaps in between where I would forget everything I’d learned and have to start over. 

I’d considered bootcamp in the past but the price tag ~20k price tag was scary since I had a lot of student debt already and no financial safety net. COVID is what ultimately pushed me into committing though since I was working as a Digital Marketer for a brewery and the lack of job security became too much. 


Deciding on a program
I did so much research but still found it very difficult to decide on a program since prior to being a SWE or full stack developer it’s hard to understand what each program is trying to do. Obviously this is different for everyone but for me the most important factors were a JavaScript stack, scholarship options or tuition deferment until after graduation and reputation/competitiveness. 

Also don’t let the reviews fool you - like many places bootcamps are great at flooding their reviews with 5 star ratings and hiding the negative ones. In fact after I started my program I went back to the reviews and really started digging. That’s when I found that all of the negative reviews were about 20 pages deep, much further than I would have ever ventured. I would honestly trust alumni for honest answers far more than reviews. 

The program
Don’t be fooled. The programs will claim to get you from 0 to SWE in 3 months. Expect a 6 - 12 months minimum. The program I attended had. 4-6 week prep followed by a month long precourse program after you are accepted followed by the 13 week program duration where they flat out state that job search is typically a 3 - 6 month process. I only had about 5 months of savings when I started so I barely made it work.

As far as difficulty and stress it’s honestly what you’d expect. 60 hour work weeks, 6 days per week and the amount of time you can put in outside of class time is very dependent. For me the hardest part wasn’t the material itself but the isolation from friends and family since you have very little free time, are usually exhausted at the end of the day and are going through something that they probably won’t understand. Be sure you set the right expectations with people since the program will truly demand almost 100% of you. 

Job Search 
A good program will have a solid job search department. I found the resources they provided very helpful and I structured my search by splitting my efforts into outreach (with people in my network and just random alum on LinkedIn) and cold applications. This might be a cardinal sin to say here but I honestly gave up doing leetcode and algorithms about 3 weeks into job searching. Despite all my practice none of the information ever sank in and I always did poorly on algo coding challenges. It felt like so much work for the off chance that I would get a problem I’d already done and since other places were offering me application based challenges I decided I’d rather just work for a place that didn’t judge the quality of their developers solely on algorithm knowledge. 

The most effective tool to getting interviews for me was random recruiters on LinkedIn. Some were obvious scams or under the line of legitimacy, but a solid 60% were legit and led to interviews (and eventually 2 offers). I noticed a lot of recruiters who were contacting me for senior level positions and I don’t know how common that is but I always responded that given my current experience I thought I’d be a better fit for junior - mid level roles and that usually still got me in the door for more appropriate positions. 

Offers
I ultimately ended up with 3 offers on the same day. These were for Boston based companies with base salary ranging from 80-85k with comp ranging from 15-25k. I had to do some real soul searching about which company to choose but decided that my ultimate goal was to have a good work/life balance and chose the place I felt would best give me that.

codingbootcamp,Stay away from Columbia Engineering Data Analytics Boot Camp,1622599994,"The boot camp was advertised in connection with Columbia University in New York City although the connection is very loose. Prior to the COVID-19 shutting down universities and public places, the university let 2U use its name, branding, and classroom space to host this boot camp.

It costs $15k for learning that you could easily learn from my projects on GitHub or any of the past boot campers' GitHub accounts. 2U's affiliation with over 20 schools also means that you are paying for the Columbia name without getting the Columbia product. The code I found most helpful for my own projects was from GitHub accounts that had done a Data Analytics Boot Camp at Berkeley or Georgia Tech or any of the schools listed on Trilogy Education Services or 2U's site.

My teacher was excellent and very knowledgeable in the topics, but the lessons were rushed and absolute understanding was expected in the modules. It was impossible for him to teach everything that he needed to and the tutors were no help. The tutoring service is outsourced and I could not understand my tutor. When I gave her my code and then she couldn't figure it out, she told me that she would do my homework and send it back to me. I turned in the homework and was complimented for the work even though I didn't understand what I was supposed to do after two meetings with my tutor.

Secondly, the school's name has a lot of notoriety and clout, but it is not worth the learning at the boot camp. Peter Thiel, a co-founder of Palantir, accepted my connection request on LinkedIn, but I learned afterward in a recruiting seminar that it is not advisable to put the boot camp from a university under your education section. So, it was misleading to many that I was only doing a boot camp with a company that Columbia had licensed their name to rather than actually attending the university and I believe he thought I was attending Columbia's Data Science Institute which is different than Columbia Engineering schools. There is a big difference and it will affect your employment opportunities later if you don't properly list the certificate.

I listed the program as a certificate when I was offered the job with Google Fiber and I had to request extra information from 2U to verify that I was enrolled in the boot camp rather than at the university. This added two extra weeks to when I could actually start working. I had to follow up three times to get the document which came after I filled out a Google form by 2U.

I recommend that you learn some math and coding on your own before applying for a master's degree program in data science or data analytics. There are many on Edx that allow you to get way more learning for a fraction of the price. Furthermore, if you graduate from those institutions you can also qualify for tax credits and financial aid. Lastly, DataCamp and Codecademy offer in-depth learning compared to what I learned for approximately 3% of the total cost. I have also heard really good things about General Assembly.

Do not go to any program by Trilogy Education Services. There are some online programs that use 2U, the company that acquired Trilogy Education Services, that may give you the learning you need to be successful but ultimately nothing beats learning math and applying the principles on your computer. 

I wish I hadn't done this program with Columbia and I will be working long hours to make up for the financial hit I incurred. Hope this is helpful."

tldr; need first users for a browser code environment

To provide some context, I am a software engineer and often have many challenges while in focus time writing code or implementing a feature. The challenges can be related to infrastructure, domain knowledge, context switch, distractions, and meta work on sorting out tasks and have contextual data before implementing, testing, and deploying things.

That being sad, I am exploring an idea of cloud coding environments with focus on improving productivity. I currently bootstrapped a browser vscode (using code-server) where one can potentially write code and compile, but my future work will be more about improve contextual experiences beyond the IDE (e2e ecosystem and bottlenecks within).

Demo link - [https://demo.sb.devsbox.io/](https://demo.sb.devsbox.io/)  
Password - demo

To proceed with my exploration, I need to find a little group of people (5+) that would find a basic online coding environment to be useful for them (for example, folks that need special infra like GPU, online classes, or small startup that would benefit from browser vscode).

Goal of this post. I want to find users that are interested in using the remote environments I provide and willing to give feedback on things they would like to see in the environment.

Why you might be interested in such environment?

* Research groups in schools that need special infra (GPU)
* Coding schools that need collaborative coding environments with some reusable components
* Startup looking to improve onboarding experience to eliminate ""works on my machine"" problem
* Any folks that don't want to overload their computer and rather run things in the cloud"
codingbootcamp,Career change via boot camp as established ~35F?,1622489809,"Coding background: self-taught beginner HTML/CSS, very occasionally put to use since 2008. Used basic HTML at work for a year to code marketing emails. Have taken bits and pieces of online coding courses in Java and Swift.

Career background: 15+ years in a liberal arts career, director-level, ~$100k, low cost of living metro area. Have wanted to change careers for a long time. 

Goals: fairly open—remote work, problem-solving, contributing to a larger goal that helps people (this can be loosely interpreted, want to use my powers for good), able to listen to music and have periods of focused work. $75k ideal to start but am aware that may be unrealistic.

codingbootcamp,Advice for a newbie about to start General Assembly?,1622466225,"Hello!

I’m about to start a cohort with General Assembly in less than a month. I have a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript fundamentals. I’m currently still working through JavaScript courses on CodeCademy and uDemy, trying to learn as much as possible before leaping headfirst into General Assembly’s course.

I’m looking for a little guidance on what languages and concepts I should study over the next three weeks, that would help me keep my head above water during the cohort. It seems like they touch on a lot of languages and frameworks that I’ve not yet had any experience with. The entry exam only covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I did struggle in the test, but got through it. It seemed more advanced in the JavaScript portion than GA’s pre-course covered. This may be by design to evaluate incoming students. I have no trouble using typical resources to search for solutions when there’s a gap in my knowledge, but this assessment was timed, leaving 1.5 minutes for each answer, and I simply didn’t have enough time to figure things out on my own. I got through it though, but it’s made me worry that the cohort could be similar, too fast paced for me to fully grasp concepts, or not given enough information to complete the prescribed tasks. I do expect the bootcamp to be tough, but I don’t want to drown.

I’m coming in potentially behind other students. I’m a college dropout who’s been working in an unrelated field for the past 12 years, and I’ve only been coding for around three months. I feel like I’ve taken to it quickly, and have honestly had a lot of fun in the process. But, I’ve read comments out there ranging from success stories from people like me, to graduates who spent the time and money and never found their foothold in the industry and went back to former careers. I’m determined for that not to be me, but it does become disheartening, especially considering that some CS degree graduates attend bootcamps and I will be competing as a programming without any academic credentials or relevant experience. It seems like I will have to find jobs entirely based on my portfolio and networking abilities, putting me behind everyone else. I’m also not located in any tech-hub cities. There are jobs available locally when I search Indeed, LinkedIn, etc, but typically request CS degree applicants. It’s a lot of money and time I’m investing with going through General Assembly, only to be unsure of my prospects afterwards. I’m not considering turning back or anything, but I am nervous about staying afloat through General Assembly as a relative newbie, and being able to switch my career afterwards without going back to my former profession.

Yes, I could’ve continued to self-study and take a longer approach, but honestly my former career is demanding of my time. I may not have the funds to support myself for an extended block of time, as I do now. I’m looking to fast-track myself a bit while I have the means, rather than taking much longer, more secure approach. I’m confident I could learn to code on my own, but there are other skills and support GA provide that make a bootcamp appealing.  

If you guys have any advice, suggestions, or comments, I really appreciate it. I’m particularly curious what you guys think I should be studying over the next three weeks before the cohort starts. I am continuing my JavaScript self-study, but should I start working on anything else, like Python, or Bootstrap? I’m nervous and trying to do whatever I can to be prepared."

codingbootcamp,Currently Avoid App Academy,1622211083,"I've lurked reddit for a long time, but I finally made an account to post about this.  


I am currently attending App Academy. I started at the beginning of May. App Academy is split into three week modules. The first module we went through was great. Full of examples and problems, discussions on where we would see the JavaScript concepts in real life, video tutorials to supplement the lectures. I felt like I was learning loads every day. It was tough, but totally fair. I would have highly recommended the program. Then came Mod 2. Without telling us they completely changed the curriculum from what we signed up for. We now get very few examples of the concepts, and very little lecture time. When we asked if we could get more example problems we were told, I kid you not, that they are too difficult to come up with and that we should write our own. One of our cohort mates came up with a set of problems that night for us. The curriculum designer has been rude and dismissive of our concerns. We have asked for an updated syllabus and have been told they don't know what they are going to put after this module. We have asked to talk to a representative from App Academy and haven't gotten it. We asked for access to the old curriculum so that we could at least see what they were doing before and were told explicitly that we could not see the old curriculum.  There are some possibly cool projects in Module 2, but we can't enjoy them because we aren't being given the tools to understand them in the first place and when we ask questions, they keep telling us that they want us to struggle and figure it out. If we get stuck it has taken about an hour to get a response from a TA so a lot of our day is spent just trying random things hoping to find an answer as we wait for help. From what I can tell (we have had a lot of discussions outside of class) the entire cohort feels this way. We are all petitioning to get some sort of response.

I did not pay this kind of money to struggle to find materials for myself outside of class and to be totally ignored by an organization when I have curriculum concerns. I could have self-taught if that was what I wanted. I paid this kind of money to streamline the material so I could struggle to become a great software developer and get there quickly! Avoid App Academy until further notice. I will try to update this, if possible, if anything changes.  


I hope this is helpful as you search for your boot-camp experience.

TL;DR: App Academy changed their curriculum and now we get no support.

Im also doing an ISA since i set side money for living expenses etc for the time i am in the bootcamp and although HR is 2k down if accepted it is a lower payoff amount in the long run caps at 22k depending on gross income compared to A/a deferred 31k tuition 

My biggest pro with HR is that they are considering doing in person class for the upcoming cohort since things are somewhat getting back to normal.

My big pro with A/a is their admission staff so far !  and they teach python instead of ruby in their 24 week curriculum, but kind of wondering if their A/a Open program is the same as the paid version.

I need help from past Alumni with honest review of their experience or any review from other bootcamps!

They say most of their instructors use Macs, but also mention the new M1 chip is not compatible with the program. I don’t have any issues getting a Mac but from what I’ve seen their prices are ridiculously high. Right now I have a Dell for work that I really like but I’ve never used Linux and I’m not sure how difficult it would be. Would really appreciate any recommendations."

codingbootcamp,[New to R] Basic question about simulation with R-Language using *apply()* functions?,1621633885,"Hi! I am new to R. I would like to ask that how can I run the following simulation with R language with using the family of  *apply()* functions instead of _for()_ loop? 

**Problem**

Let *x* , *y* and *z* are three *n*-vectors of proportions ( that is, I might draw them from uniform distribution within the interval 0 and 1).  Suppose that 

+ *d(x , y)* is the Euclidean distance between *x* and *y*
+ *d(y,  z)* is the Euclidean distance between *y* and *z*
+ *d(z, x)* is the Euclidean distance between *z* and *x*.

Now assume that I have a function *f* (which is a scalar) as follows:

*f* = *d(x , y)*  + *d(y,  z)*  - *d(z, x)* 

**Simulation**

I draw *x*, *y* and *z* (say, size of *n=5* ) from uniform distribution and find *f*. I save these four things an array or matrix with column names  *x*, *y* , *z* and *f*.

Then, I want to repeat this process 10,000 times and construct the histogram of *f*.

**Note:** I can do the above with using loop but could you guys help me to run the same above thing without using loop on R?

Thanks"

Currently, I am just finished my tech interview with one Bootcamp and I hope I can get in. If it's what I expected I think the program will be started on Aug. 

Since I am targeting to find a job and I realize that Leetcode practicing is super important, and I also heard that I will need to learn JAVA or Python for me to practice Leetcode more efficiency. I am wondering should I take the time before the program starts to learn python/java or it will be better for me to just focus on what Bootcamp gave me for pre-course, I know they will provide some pre-course material but I think it will be more focus on JS and front-end.

Or is there anyone who can provide experience about what will it look like for job hunting after Bootcamp graduation, is that ok for me to only know JS?

codingbootcamp,5 Reasons Why I Love Being a Web Developer,1621203895,"Suppose you are looking into a career change or in school for software development. But you are not sure if Web Development is the right choice. As Full Stack Software Engineer, I have thought of 5 reasons why I love Web Development, and hopefully, it will help you answer some of your questions. 

1. **Web Developers Are In-Demand:**  
Your friends want a website, startups need a website, big companies need developers who can support and build new features in their existing website. Moreover, web technology allows developers to build not only websites but they could also build apps for smartphones or create system applications. Since web development becomes more flexible, businesses come up with more use cases to solve specific problems. Still, unfortunately, there are not enough developers who can build and maintain the codebase. As you are reading this, you have probably noticed that there are a lot of open jobs. So if you are planning to become a web developer, after 4 to 6 months (depending on the learning path you took), you could get your first web developer job. 
2. **It Provides Good Salary:**  
To look at this data more accurately, I would recommend using Glassdoor or Indeed to get a more accurate number based on your location. But depending on your location, Junior Web Developers could get a minimum of $45,000 annually, and Senior Developers could get around $120,000 annually. The other reason why you should be using Glassdoor and Indeed is that you want to get an idea of what other people in your area are getting so you can negotiate your salary much better during the interview. Your salary will also depend on what language and side of web development you have chosen. So when you are comparing, I would recommend comparing Backend vs Frontend vs Full Stack Developer salaries.
3. **You Can Choose How You Want To Work:**  
One common path that we all take is working 9 to 5, and we are happy with that. But what if working full time is not for you or let's say you got a lot of time to kill after hours, what do you do? A lot of web developers would use that time to look for a client and have hustle on the side. It's a common thing among web developers, and by doing that, they are making extra money on the side. If your freelance path looks successful and profitable, you could make that into your full-time job and register yourself as a business. But this is something you would have to look into as this depends on your location. 
4. **Web Development Has A Big Choice Of Languages:**  
We got PHP, NodeJs, Python, Java, C#, Deno, Ruby On Rails, etc. Each one of them is different and has its own purpose or could open up other options for you. For example: if you are planning to learn NodeJs, since it's built on JavaScript, you can take that skill and apply it both on Backend and Frontend. In comparison, PHP can only be used on the Backend side. Now you might be thinking, ""why should I learn PHP if I can use it only on the backend?"". PHP has been around for a long time now, so many enterprise companies and corporations are built on PHP. When you decide what language you should focus on, I recommend doing a little research on the most common or popular language in your area. It will help you find a job much faster (and you won't be wasting time learning something you don't need).
5. **You can choose on what side of web development you want:**  
Whenever I say ""I am a Web Developer"", it could be unclear to other developers because there are three main parts to it. I could be a Frontend, Backend, or Full Stack Software Developer. We have a preference on what it is we want to focus on, so a lot of people choose only one. As Frontend Developer, you will most likely use only one framework: ReacJs, Vuejs, Angular, etc (depending on the company stack). Frontend doesn't have business logic. As a result, it's much simpler to work with. On the other hand, Backend is much more complex because that's where a lot of business logic goes. You will have to consider many things like security, performance, and scalability of the application that you are building. Full Stack Software Developer is a combination of Frontend and Backend. As you can see, you don't have to know how web development works to 100%. You can always choose the side that looks most appealing to you, and if you want to expand the knowledge, the option is always there.  

These are my top 5 significant reasons why I love Web Development. If you want to know more about it, I would recommend taking a look at and subscribing to my YouTube channel DevPool as my goal is to help beginners and juniors to succeed in the tech industry. If you are looking for some mentorship, I also have TechDevPool 1 on 1 session tailored for you where I use my years of experience and point you in becoming a Web Developer in a matter of months, not years.

I am an assistant store manager, on my way to becoming a store manager, but I hate it. I can't stand retail and I want out. I would love to get out sooner rather than later. I have an opportunity to quit and attend a boot camp. It's a little risky financially speaking, but I have thought it out a lot and talked to others about it and we all seem to agree that it's a good idea.

I have looked into several boot camps and a lot seem to require some sort of experience. I have only done a few hours of a Udemy course. I am leaning more towards General Assembly because it seems to be very beginner-friendly. I have also seen people on here compliment it. My only issue is that General Assembly's course doesn't start until September. I'm on the fence about waiting. On one hand, it would give me an opportunity to save more and continue doing more self-study, on the other hand, I get sick at the thought of staying at my job that long. Does anyone know of any other beginner-friendly boot camps I could look into?

codingbootcamp,Just curious about leaning coding... and boot camps,1620797294,"Hey coders.  I'm toeing the waters and am curious about coding and coding bootcamps. I am generally curious about web development languages and have been for years. I have a degree in a foreign language and understand logic and how algorithms work. I have a very analytical mind.  Maybe it stems from that? 20 years ago I taught myself HTML for fun when Geocities was just coming into its own.  Although coding languages are light years ahead now, the spark has never really died down.

Currently I'm an instructional designer and novice Storyline programmer.  I have a great job, make great $$ and am 100% remote, regardless of the pandemic I'm at home and my work is very flexible. I enjoy working for the company I'm with (a large Fortune 500).  So I'm not jumping ship or desperate for a change.

It's a bit of a fascination, I just love understanding the nuts and bolts and how things work on anything, I'm really just drawn to wanting to learn computer science theory and programming languages. I love solving problems and fixing things.  Should've studied CS in college but I didn't. Here I am. I can see how learning coding can enhance my current position or open up new opportunities within my company.  But I'm being realistic and not looking to quit my day job, which I like. However I am a busy working mom with two littles and there must be some payoff for the sacrifice and investment of my time. 

Are these bootcamps worth it for someone like me?  Are there better resources out there than shelling out a few grand if I'm not expecting a major life change? What's your best advice? 

TIA"
codingbootcamp,Summer coding bootcamps,1620772497,"
I am currently pursuing a major in Management Information Systems with a minor in IST. My current course curriculum does not have a heavy focus in coding/developing.This upcoming summer I have no internship lined up so I am thinking about taking a summer bootcamp to help improve my resume and boost my coding skills.

I have a job available to me at a golf shop that will bring me in some money to spend my next semester but i feel spending the summer taking classes will help me in the long run. My question is will any of these summer courses be worth it when applying for internships or would working be a better option? Are these summer bootcamps even that effective in teaching, if so what are some reputable programs? 

I just feel like I do not have much to show skill wise to really help me stand out in my field. I really want to move into IT consulting, I know that is not as code intensive as other tech fields but I still feel it would help to have this as a skill. 

Any advice really helps!

Edit: Also should I take a coding program or would another type of program match better with my Major/ intended field?"

So, I searched LinkIn's GeneralAssembly Bootcamp profile page (since it's one that i will porbably attend - they do it part-time unlike some others available in the U.K), but they dont list it's Alumni, instead i came accross [this rather dissapointing s](https://imgur.com/a/udiQfHs)tatistic - most of their employees are former GA participants.  However, Codeworks, for example [does](https://www.linkedin.com/school/codeworks/people/) include thei Alumni, which feels more open/transparent. Not sure if this is hugely significant (Iwill porbably do the GA course for lack of other optionsher in the U.K)..but what do others think?  I do think it's strange that an educational centre would omit their Alumni like this though"

codingbootcamp,Early Dismissal Flatiron-Owe Full Tuition.,1620712141,"Hey guys!

In a pinch at the moment. I'm trying my best to see were to seek guidance. 

This time last year I signed up for the software engineering full-time course (15k)

They offered me this ISA program were they partner with a lender and you start paying 10% of your income with  3 months grace period. They will start taking 10% of your income for 48months or 21 payments which ever comes first. If you cant pay one month they will add a month to the *48

All sounded great, I started in June target graduation in November. I went ahead and got going did great for my first 2 modules out of the 5. Towards that time In October we got a new instructor which really changed the vibe of the course. We went from a teacher to a tech guy. Most of my peers voiced this out. We took it upon ourselves to create peer groups and learn within our means. Instead of following the instructor how we used to.

I finished my third module project and I went to get my assessment. The assessor seemed to be extremely busy. I did great and she invited me for some live coding the following Monday to finish up my assessment. She never showed up.

I communicated that to my instructor, he asked me to reach out to her, he claimed she is extremely busy. She eventually got back to me and scheduled me for that Friday( tell me why she had to leave mid session)She said she was going to write everything up and get back to me.

She never did.

Flustered and frustrated I stood my ground.

Couple weeks later my instructor reached out to me claiming I didn't pass, I expressed what happened again and said she never got back to me.

He said that I should of just went with another assessment instructor instead 🤦‍♂️ 
I said I didn't know that was an option and he advised if I wanted to take one that week.

I went its been several weeks i'm not ready. Then said they were going to reach back out to me.

December hit. He reaches out saying a higher up will contact me to switch me to another cohort/class 

The higher up emailed me in mid December, in short the email said, either switch cohorts or withdraw (rude ok)...

I responded to him and I didn't hear back till prob Mid January and didn't get a appointment with him till late February.

He put me in the next cohort saying that was my only option. (I had to less than weeks to start)

I asked for the schedule because I needed 10 days for a medical appointment. He said someone will reach out to me.

No one did.

I filed a ticket they reached out the next day
They sent me the slack and the logins. I informed the instructor of my situation. She told me were to find the schedule.

To my surprise, they changed the whole platform very text heavy and it resembled a college platform (it was called canva)

I tried to organize my life again back into coding and I couldn't submit my project in time. After my medical appointment I got sick, and the project was due a couple days later. (This was my fault for sure)

So I thought ok Full-time is not for me at this moment.

A couple days later I get a email from student services. Lady was straight to bone on dismissal me from the program, not leveling with me at all. Anytime I brought something up she will go its in our contact, if you don't pass a module twice you'll get dismissed. Informed her no one gave me a heads up,  and that I would like to pursue self-pace. She said I can't due self-pace because i'm academic probation.. I went no one told me that either. She referenced the contract again.

I even asked to plea my case and she said you can, but i'm still filing your dismissal paper work. She said my tuition will get adjusted and that team was going to reach out.

So in true Flatiron fashion they sent me an email charging me the full tuition. Even though I didn't finish."

Let me tell you a bit of myself so you guys can give me your opinion. 

I'm from Brazil and I have an Associate Degree in IT. I still need to do an equivalence of my diploma (Brazil to USA), so I do have a background in IT. I did learn HTML and CSS, a bit of PHP and JavaScript, but I was a Network Administrator back in Brazil. Ive wanted to learn how to code but I was a little scared and in Brazil it wasn't a good career at that time. Now, I think its the right time. 

I moved to USA 4 years ago and  I want to go back to school somehow but college is not an option because its 4 years and im almost 30.  I work full time but I could do an online part time program.

I did look into free bootcamps but I feel like I would need some sort of direction, certification, network etc because I don't know anyone here lol

I looked into FullStack but they are gonna be back on campus soon so June Cohort will be in person. They were my #1 option..

codingbootcamp,"PSA: For outcomes data, look at BPPE ""Regulatory Information"" in addition to CIRR reports.",1620387865,"I've been researching bootcamps, and have learned something very important that doesn't seem to be common knowledge on this sub.

Bootcamps that operate in California are required by state law to publish ""School Performance Fact Sheets"" by the California BPPE (Bureau for Private Post-secondary Education), in accordance to the state's standards and definitions of terminology.

Links to these fact sheets usually can be found at the very bottom (footer) of bootcamp websites, labeled as ""Regulatory Information,"" or you can also try ""BOOTCAMP_URL/regulatory-information,"" or straight-up emailing the bootcamp to request the information (which you are entitled to). 

In many cases, the data in these fact sheets will line up with the outcomes data bootcamps publish on their websites or on CIRR, but there are exceptions! So make sure to double-check whether the bootcamps you're eyeing pass the muster. 

Also, it seems to be a common misconception, but **CIRR does NOT audit the outcomes reports it publishes.** That third-party auditing they're talking about is performed by **CPA firms**, and any pdf file on CIRR should contain an independent auditor's report from one of those firms. If not, the veracity of the data is in question. 

Hope this helps out some people."
codingbootcamp,"Thinkful bootcamp, part time vs full time",1620367056,"Hi, so I'm considering taking a thinkful coding bootcamp. I am a recent mathematics graduate but that hasn't really opened any doors for me, so I'm looking for a new direction. I've taken a couple of coding course for java and c which I really really enjoyed. I like thinkful because it guarantees that you don't pay if you don't get a job that pays over 40k. However, I'm really struggling to choose between the part time and full time options. Full time is 50 hrs a week for 5 months and part time is 30 hours for 6 months. My two main concerns are inability to work while in full time or lack of structure with part time. I have a small saving that I could possibly live off of, but then I would have no more savings. But I'm concerned that I won't be successful with the lack of structure and that their might be more holes in my learning because of my lack of experience with the part time option.

Hi there! 

Hoping to look for some direction as I haven’t been able to find anything online with information. 

I recently graduated from the UT coding bootcamp and my instruct and SSM referred me for a position with Trilogy. I chose the central grader position bc it allows me the flexibility to keep my current job (which I love) while also getting my foot in the tech door. 

My question is,

codingbootcamp,University partnered with a company called Trilogy,1620243100,"So I've been applying to different boot camps these past few months and found one that was advertised using a pretty well-known university in my area. The details looked good enough, so I scheduled a phone call. The phone call went pretty well but was similar to all my phone calls with other boot camps. 

Anyway last night I was looking over the documents that I needed to sign and I found out the Bootcamp isn't actually being run by the people at the university but instead is being run by a company called ""Trilogy Education Services"". Looking around the internet and I found that this company partners with other major universities and colleges and make it look super deceiving by using websites like bootcamp.\[university-name\].edu

Nothing indicated that this was the case beforehand and made it seem like this was taught by the university itself, so this is raising some red flags. I probably will not go through this Bootcamp anymore. Just curious if anyone has any personal experience with this program or was ever caught in this scheme before.

codingbootcamp,Graduated Nucamp Coding Bootcamp!!!,1620074483,"I just graduated the Full Stack Web Development Course!!! 

Well my friends it has been and arduous journey with moments that I asked myself if I can do this over and over. This experience has changed my perception of self-learning. Although the boot camp had instructors and fellow students majority of the time you are alone trying to understand what the course is trying to teach you.   


All in all I do feel like I got what I paid for and for those who are thinking about taking the leap into Nucamp, realize that after the boot camp you aren't ""job ready"". You will still need to continue to sharpen your skills in the concepts that you were exposed to from the boot camp as well as complete a career planning course that will help to make you marketable.   


My next steps are to hit the books, Udemy, YouTube and review the course (mainly react/redux) and get a strong portfolio of 10 projects that I independently create so when I land an interview I can explain every detail to prove my knowledge.   
**I'll be going over 5 aspects of the boot camp that define my rating of Nucamp:**  


1. Learning Platform
2. Instructors
3. Skills Acquired
4. Content Quality
5. Cost  


* **Learning Platform**  
The Nucamp learning website had an overall nice and very user friendly design. You can easily figure out what you are going to learn as well as how much time you should logically dedicate per day. I put in 2-4 hours a day and I wouldn't suggest any less or more time. Nucamp is definitely on to something with their very front end focused curriculum using the most popular frameworks and APIs. The website just got a redesign too! It looks so much more premium with the Flat UI design.  

* **Instructors**  
This was probably my favorite aspect of the course. 
   * Bootstrap instructor (David-mid 20s-male) was in the industry and could break down what was occurring to anyone.
   * React instructor (Mike-mid 30s-male) graduate of Nucamp working as a React Dev really took the extra time throughout the week to drive home these concepts in ""free"" study sessions
   * React-Native instructor (Crystal-early 20s-female) worked in Seattle and was a ray of sunshine that aided in solidifying our understand of React/Redux while steadily reviewing the new/different aspects of React-Native
   * NodeJS, Express, MongoDB instructor (Andrew-mid 30s-male) worked in Sacramento for a law-firm as a Senior Backend Dev who was overqualified to teach this course. He even gave us a small career planning overview, interview advice and often used good analogies to simplify the tough subject of back end.  

* **Skills Acquired**
   * The number one skill I have acquired from this boot camp was how to READ JavaScript. I can sit down and trace the data up and back throughout all the asynchronous confusion and break it down to anyone.
   * Experience in Bootstrap, React, React-Native, Redux, APIs, Git, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, how to use VS Code, how to make a mock-up website, how to use Slack, how to use Postman, my typing improved, and how to read documentation to further my understanding of what is going on! 
   * I can absolutely flush out a website/mobile app and provide dynamic actions for a user all the while manage the state of said application and even create a server while connecting that data to the server.  

* **Content Quality**  
By this I mean the quality of the e-learning experience through the videos and documentation added in the additional resources after each overview/exercise.
   * Audio Quality
      * Minaes (course instructor) audio was hit and miss IMO. You would often hear background noise and her slight accent was a little off putting.
   *  Video Quality
      * Nucamps content was hosted on unlisted YouTube videos that were often short and long. The issue being that if you missed a specific thing or wanted to review one aspect of a framework or API you have to scrub through a lot of content. 
   * Content
      * Each subject covered is so extensive. You learn the original way to do something down to the simplest albeit longest way to do it in JS then you learn a tool that does all of that in a few lines of code. Sounds redundant but knowing how something works is better than just using it. So much content tbh. 
* **Cost**
   * **$1765** at **$353**/month
      * I enrolled in Nucamp sometime in November for the Full Stack Web Development course. My class began on Dec 7 2020 and you had to make an upfront initial payment of your monthly amount. Being that I graduated this month my last payment ended up being in March.
      * I have seen that they even offer **$8**/month and then upon graduation you pay the rest of the course off.
      * You can't beat this price to be honest. 5.5 Months of learning and access to the course forever (they will update it soon). I wasn't comfortable spending 10k on something I didn't know was a scam or not. Money well spent.

**MY RATING: 8.5/10**

Such a good experience, not too easy and not too hard. I look forward to making a new post of me landing my first job!!!

codingbootcamp,How many hours per day you should spend learning programming,1619983085," 

As a Fullstack Software Engineer, I have already walked the path of learning. I wanted to share some of my tips, what I have witnessed from others and what worked for them.

1. Every number is different for each person:  
Anyone can sit and start learning to program, but each person will arrive at the destination based on the path they took and if they had any help on the way. I have seen people taking almost a year and some just about 4 months to become web developers and find their first job. People that took a long time to learn had to make a lot of try and error, and unfortunately, no one was there to guide them. So if you are starting in web or software development in general, don't get discouraged because it's taking you a long time to understand a topic. But use this as an opportunity to learn and perhaps try to find a mentor who walked that path and can guide you.
2. Consistency is the key:  
If you have decided to become a web developer (or any software developer), give yourself a deadline and how many hours you can allocate a day to work toward that goal. Now, this part is very important, ready? Be honest with yourself. If you say 12 hours a day and your deadline is 6 months from now. Can you study every day for 12 hours consistently for 6 months? Well, first, you shouldn't do that, so be reasonable and very critical of this part as you may discourage or burn yourself out halfway.
3. Be patient  
Like for anything in life, you need to be patient about the process. 4 months or 1 year, and it will take time one way or the other. All you can do is prepare and have fun while doing it. There is nothing much to say about this one, but it is essential to point that out since many of us want to get to the destination fast and forget that it takes time, and you do need patience for this.

These are my top 3 points that should help you predict how many hours you may need before getting that first job. You can subscribe to my channel DevPool as my goal is to help beginners and juniors succeed in the tech industry.

codingbootcamp,"Advice needed! Should I do boot camp? If so, hack reactor or app academy?",1619830614,"Hello community! 

I’m currently 6-7 years into my career but wanted to change to software engineer. I’ve been working in big tech companies in Bay Area in the past few years but in a different field. I quit my job a couple of months ago and I learnt python from online course on my own. I was wondering if you think I should pursue boot camp or if that’s a waste of money. I do want to change career ASAP because time cost /opportunity cost is huge for me. After reading some posts in this sub I realize boot camp was not glamorous as it’s shown, so I’m a bit concerned on the ROI for boot camp, however I’m also doubting I could just become a self-taught software engineer and get a decent paying job in Bay Area just because I know smart driven people who have done boot camp are still struggling to find a decent engineer job in today’s age (maybe covid impacted), so I’m really struggling to find an answer right now on what I should do next. 

I consider myself as hardworking, driven professional with good career history, however the thought of struggling for 1 year even with boot camp help and fear for constant failures in a unknown field still frightened me. 

I did some research for hack reactor and app academy, these two are the top two I’m considering right now, but seems like a lot of alumni from these boot camps that got associated to FAANG companies on LinkedIn do not work as software engineer there, instead they work as like recruiter, operations etc non-engineer roles. So I’m more and more suspicious of the outcomes of the boot camps now. Please correct me if I’m reading it wrong. 

Thank you for your advice!"
codingbootcamp,Boot camp + internship = hopefully full time hire?,1619813878,"So I’m doing a full time coding boot camp in data science right now (CodeUp) and I’m liking it a lot. One problem is that it’s a lot easier than I was expecting. I didn’t have any coding background minus one CS class in college and even then I felt like we were spending a lot of time on pretty basic things. 

I also was expecting to get tons of homework. They made it seem like it would be a bad idea to work and do the program at the same time because of work outside of class hours (9-5, Monday-Friday). That hasn’t been the case at all so that leaves me with a lot of free time.

I’m only a year out of college and I’ve never had a full time role, only some part time jobs and internships. Most of the people who go through the program are much older and have more work experience, so I felt like I should do something to add to my resume. The program ends on September 3, so I figured there’s still a lot of time for me to do some sort of volunteer work or part time work to get some more experience.

I reached out to one startup I liked and offered to do some work for them. The guy I talked to seemed nice but didn’t seem like he had the capacity for it. I reached out to another startup and managed to get a 30 minute interview with two data analysts at the company. I just got the email today saying I got the position and it’s paid! I’m so excited.

I would really like to get a full time job as soon as possible after finishing in September so hopefully this internship experience helps, as well as all the projects I’ll work on during the boot camp.

Just thought I’d share in case anyone else is feeling like their boot camp isn’t challenging them enough. Don’t hesitate to offer yourself up, sometimes you’ll get lucky!"

codingbootcamp,Looking for advice - is a coding bootcamp worth it for me?,1619782535,"Hi all!

Hope this is OK to post. I'm thinking of doing a coding bootcamp as I try to figure out what to do with myself. I would definitely like to build my own websites/apps and I think being a dev would suit me well.

A short bit of background:

* PhD in computational biology -- spent 5 years coding in Python, but almost entirely self-taught except for a semester of Java and a couple of classes on data structures &amp; machine learning. Very much focused on scripting / getting the answer, not writing long-lasting code, if that makes sense.
* Worked in consulting after -- last case, I was product owner in an agile transformation of a pharma where the team developed a web app for rare disease diagnosis. 
* After that, became a product manager in pharma for about 8 months before leaving because the company was asking for 60+ hour weeks and that's the reason I left consulting 

Where I'm at:

* Doing an MFA in Fiction writing - classes are 2x/week next semester, 8-10:30pm Wednesday and 7-9:30pm Thursday (Eastern). This means I can't do most of the part-time bootcamps, unfortunately, because they all seem to be T/Th except for the one I've found that's M-W, which also overlaps with class for about half an hour
* I really love coding and think that developing FT will be a good counterbalance to the creative work I also enjoy doing 
* I'm currently doing the App Academy Open curriculum and really enjoying it, but I'm worried that I'm just going to be stuck in the self-taught thing again and that it won't ""count"" for a FT dev job.

I'm currently leaning towards the Actualize bootcamp because the hours work for me and it has good reviews here on reddit, but I'm worried it's not ""thorough"" enough given the cost and it doesn't have too many reviews.

Really appreciate any thoughts anyone has. Thanks very much for your time!"
codingbootcamp,"Full-stack development, is it real, and if so, the best courses available for beginners.",1619772994,"So, after the year that we've all had, looking for work has become a daily routine, as well as maybe for some of us (me), a possible change in careers.

I've always been involved one way or another with the internet since its beginnings, my first experience was 'the draw'...basically teletext was the start, back in the old days. Yes, I'm that old!

But today, I'm looking to actually move into the arena, and start learning, from actual courses, rather than working it out myself. Which leads me to the topic above.

There are many blogs out there detailing the way forward as a full-stack developer, as well as many, many articles arguing that there is no such thing. 

Most of the blogs are linked to courses available, at a fee of course, where you can learn to become a full-stack developer in 3-6 months, which sounds unlikely! But I have done some HTML, CSS, C++, not recently, and only for specific projects. So I basically worked out what I needed to do for what I wanted.

So now I would like to know from those of you that actually do know, are there full-stack developers, and if so, where would they start?"

I've read a few posts on the sub and on the internet and came to the conclusion that you get what you put into it. I have also seen great stories where people go from working dead-end jobs and attend a boot camp and pretty much change their lives for the better. 

But I haven't seen many posts or videos about people landing a job after attending a Bootcamp, there are a few but not many. I'm not worried that I won't get anything out of the class or that'll drop out or fail, because of a bit of past experience with frameworks and languages covered over these courses. However, I'm worried about spending over $10-17k for just a certificate and portfolio project(s) will not be enough to land a job and this will just be a gigantic headache and a mistake that'll take years to finically recover from.

codingbootcamp,Consequence of Covid - Galvanize permanently online,1619677227,"This is mostly just a public service announcement for anyone who was planning on attending a Galvanize bootcamp in the near future. Here's the scoop:   


I was doing the pre-course work for Galvanize with the expectation that I'd be jumping in their upcoming cohort.  As of my first talks with them, the program was temporarily online due to Covid, but federal legislation that was passed last year ensured Veterans would still be able to keep their BAH   
 (housing allowance).  I do not have a coding or CS background, so I've been studying my ass off preparing for the interview this week.  Now I've been informed that they've made the decision to move the program online permanently, so my BAH is going from the original \~$5k to \~$900/month. That's a bit of a fucking game changer, and not enough for me to get by in SoCal. SO... if you were planning on attending their bootcamp in person in the future, or if you are a veteran who needs to survive off your BAH, shop elsewhere.  I'm not saying they're a bad company, I can't speak to the quality of their bootcamp, I just happened to be fucked over by their ""sudden"" transition.  I did not hear anything about their Hack Reactor bootcamps, so maybe if you're interested in Web Development, you might be able to do those in person?  Or maybe those are transitioning online also?   


Unrelated note: Why are 96% of people in this sub afraid to name which bootcamp they graduated from?  This is a sub for people who are interested in coding bootcamps, presumably most viewed by those who are trying to do research on which one isn't just a money-grab, yet nobody is willing to name-drop.  ""Shhh.... DM me and I'll tell you.""  Why?   If they did right by you, give them props!  If you had a negative experience, why not help someone else by getting that information out there?"

I'm currently taking a HTML/CSS/JS Udemy course and I feel great about it, moving at a good pace and understanding it. I have a general understanding on where to go from here but the ""self-taught"" title scares me a bit. I think some sort of formal education (bootcamp) could potentially be good for the resume and the job placement aspect is attractive as well. But if I feel like I CAN self study, should I skip a bootcamp? Or would a bootcamp be a better route? How hard actually is it to land a job without a bootcamp? Any insight appreciated, I like the idea of saving $15k but if job placement is going to be an issue I may just have to cough it up.

I am hesitant to give them all this information, as it is very sensitive. They don't really give a reason as to why, except there sponsors who request this information.

codingbootcamp,Are coding bootcamps worth doing in 2021?,1619408325,"Hello,

I wanted to make this post in getting some thoughts on doing a bootcamp in 2021.

Bit of a background of myself, based in NYC area, I'm currently 27 years old, majored in Chemical Engineering and currently working in the Biotech industry doing equipment validation. The job I have currently pays pretty well and I like my team. However, the work itself I have felt really isn't too challenging and I feel I am not learning much. I had always been interested in working as a software engineer/developer and have made the decision to make a career switch by doing a part-time bootcamp. I am currently learning Javascript and have been practicing coding problems on CodeWars, etc.

Here are where I have some concerns regarding bootcamps from the research I have done. Bootcamps have started around 2011-2012 and have taken off ever since then. It seems that there is a clear saturation in the job market for junior software positions and have been for a while, making the competition extremely high as many grads from all different coding bootcamps are applying to the same positions. I'm sure this applies to popular tech cities like NYC/SF , not sure how it is for other cities. It seems that a lot of the grads (from 2020) I have seen on LinkedIn for the bootcamp I was planning to attend haven't been able to get any positions (I'm sure COVID had a profound effect though). 

Despite these concerns, I am still planning to enroll and am determined to put my 110% effort if I get accepted. But part of me feels like I have missed the train on doing these bootcamps.  I hope I don't discourage anyone reading this who were planning on enrolling in a bootcamp. I just had some concerns and wanted to see if anyone had some thoughts/advice on this.

Thank you!"

I really like the idea of a boot camp because it will force me to at least show up to a class and provide some sort of structure while I’m getting started. I have no coding or IT experience, and am using code academy in the mean time to get some of the fundamentals under my belt before signing up for a class. 

Thank you guys for reading and I appreciate any feed back y’all may have."

I just dropped a video on YouTube.

Self-taught vs. Coding Bootcamp vs. College Degree.

Should I put $60k into a college degree? Or $15k into a coding boot camp? Or save ALL the money and be self-taught? 

Which one is best?

I started my learning back up on my own a couple of months ago, lately I've been working through Angela Yu's Udemy course and have learned a lot, but I'm struggling with not having the accountability of daily/weekly progress and not really having anyone to help guide my learning.

Since I want accountability and mentorship and further learning, I'm wondering if Nucamp is a good option? I just don't want to spend that money and end up with a disengaged teacher who is there for a paycheck rather than to actually mentor/teach (suffered through enough of those to get my college degree). And I'm concerned that since it covers so many different topics that they might not cover anything in depth enough to be useful.

So any experiences from Nucamp? Oh, and I'm wondering if you actually can form bonds with your classmates or if it's all just solo work? I saw something about class sizes limited to 12, but don't know how accurate that actually is since it's online."

codingbootcamp,In person classes vs online only?,1616962015,"I’ve been looking into coding camps for a while now and one near me is starting up in-person classes in a couple months. I’m fully vaccinated and would be okay with taking classes in person since they’re keeping the class small but it’s newer and shorter than bootcamp #2, which is the one I wanted to do the most. Bootcamp #2 is a few months longer, more expensive, and will be online only for the foreseeable future. It’s based in a different state that I wouldn’t mind moving to, so I also prefer this one because they have a lot of connections in that area. 


I’ve never taken an online class before, does it significantly impede learning? I’m leaning towards bootcamp #2 because I think it sounds awesome to not have to commute to class+I like the extended length but I have my concerns about remote learning and if it’s worth the tuition.

codingbootcamp,Tips To Find Your First Junior Software Developer Position,1616936574," **1. Search by language or framework:**

The first time when I was looking for a Junior Web Developer position, I would type something like ""junior web developer"", and the result would consist of languages that I didn't want to specialize in or not all junior positions would come up as a lot of companies don't have the same job title. So I changed my strategy a bit by searching for the language or framework I wanted to specialize in. By doing that, I was able to filter out all the jobs that I didn't want to apply for or shouldn't even waste my time looking at it in the first place.

**2. Tailor your skillset to job market demand:**

Once you followed the first step and found a few awesome jobs, it's time to compare them to each other. As you compare them, look at the most common things first and make them your #1 priority. If you want to be a frontend developer and see that ReactJs is the most common framework that companies are asking for, consider putting more of your focus and efforts into ReactJs technology. This approach can help you filter out things that you don't need to spend weeks or months studying.

**3. Sharpen your skills by setting challenges for yourself:**

About every experienced developer would say that you need to work on a project that could help you progress, and they are not wrong. However, how do you track your progress? In my case, I gave myself 10 hours to develop a project using technologies and technics that I have never used. The goal was to develop a single-page application using AngularJs (when it was hot), make it responsive, functional, and beautiful UX/UI, and deploy it onto a server. I was able to accomplish it all in 8 hours and prove it during the interview. Working on a project for more than 2 to 3 months just become an unpaid job.

These are my top 3 points that helped me get my first Junior Full Stack Developer position. But are there more tips for it? 100% yes, and you can find them on my YouTube channel DevPool. Subscribe to my channel as my goal is to help beginners and juniors succeed in the tech industry.

codingbootcamp,"""Corporate"" Dojo",1615861546,"After ***3 years of employment*** with my company I ran into a red flag with my background check. I listed Coding Dojo as education and experience. Cause of the pandemic Chicago Dojo decided to disconnect their phone lines and not be reachable except for email. I tried to avoid an issue by requesting a phone number instead of email. Corporate Dojo also does not have a phone line, but only email. With $15K tuition, they can't afford a phone line? Corporate Dojo is in Seattle and I have never been to Seattle. They decided to tell me employer that I never worked there, and I never claimed I worked in Seattle Dojo. From local Chicago Dojo, all I needed was a casual statement saying that yes I did attend between these dates to have valid experience and education. They would not even do this. I explained that after 3 years of employment, this is not the time to get on a high pedestal/soap box about my request. They drew an imaginary line and refused to help. For a place that isn't FAFSA eligible and non-accredited this ridiculous. They risked my job on semantics and lost.

Clarification on the program. It is not a 14 week program. You have 3 3-week stacks with a project week at the end. You start out with the 2-week fundamentals stack. If you pace yourself for a 4-week program you will not be able to join then contribute to a project. You will need to rush and be eligibile for a project team.

It really needs to be a 17-week program. They raised their tuition but kept the 11-week program.

During my time there, one instructor did not know how to use Git, and lost a whole days assignment trying to ""fix"" a Git issue. 10-hours of work gone, and he just walked away.

Another instructor got fired ( I notice a trend here, Coding Dojo likes to get people fired) In the middle of a stack!

Even though this is a ""bootcamp,"" during Thanksgiving week there was no enforcement or expectations about coding. We have no vacations and are paying for full time. It's a ""bootcamp."" Yet our project week was lost because the instructors/boss decided this was okay. There were no classes on Thurs/Fri yet we didn't get our days moved into next week.

I should get a weeks worth of money back.

Last stack the online program was totally unprepared! The cirriculum had no way to tie the back and front end together. The concepts were foreign to each other and no way to connect them. They should have suspended classes if they did not have the material. After 3 wasted days, one instructor explained it in 20 MINUTES!

The 4 A-Grade (black belt) students with prior coding experience could not figure it out. They said 'oh Google changed their stack and it's too new.' Then give everyone a refund, suspend classes, or get your crap together.

Same thing that happened at Thanksgiving happened again, except for Christmas and New Years. How is this a 'bootcamp.' Either enforce rules, or start the cohort one week ahead to avoid multiple holiday conflicts. 

Would you want to go to a vocational training program that gets you released after 3 years of employment? Think about that before you pay your money to attend. They do not have your back after they take your cash."

codingbootcamp,I am facing problem to solve this coding problem in javascript,1613957195,"In the olden days, playing marbles used to be every kid's favorite game. George is a marble collector. He has a special habit of putting marbles of the same color into one box and numbering each marble contained therein, starting from 1 (i.e: there are 5 marbles in a box, and they are respectively numbered from 1 to 5).  


One day, Richie came to visit George. The two played marbles together and after a while, Richie suddenly came up with a new game: to count the available alternatives to pick a marble from each box so that any two chosen marbles have different numbers.  


However, as the boys could not reach an agreement on their results, they asked for your support in coding a program which could deliver the correct result.  


Constraints:  
\+ n &lt;= 10\^5  
\+ Number of marbles in each box &lt;= 10\^5.  


Input:  
\+ The first line contains an integer N as the number of marble-containing boxes, followed by n numbers representing the respective number of marbles contained in the boxes.  


Output:  
\+ Print the result. As it could be a large number, you can output it as modulo 10\^9+7.

So I despise my current job and I desperately want a new career. Not just a new job, but something that I can do long term that I don't hate and will provide a living that isn't pay check to pay check. 

I am gearing myself to enroll in a 6 month long bootcamp for coding but I am seeing a lot of internet talk about how programming jobs are becoming near impossible to get; like even the ones that don't even pay that well. I am fine with working my ass off, I've done that my entire life, but, I just don't want to jump in the coding waters only to find that there's no fish. I hear data science is the way to go, but I only have a silly bachelors' degree in silly english and I don't think a data science bootcamp is enough to get me a job. So, in my ignorance, I think that coding bootcamp is my best bet if I want to get into the field.

I have a new baby, my current job leaves me in poverty, I live in an apartment where the cockroaches have lived in my kitchen so long that I've started to identify the ones that keep coming back. I am so desperate for a change and I think I will be happy as a coder/programmer/developer.

I have a life savings and I am about to spend it all on bootcamp and the job search afterwards. If I live sleep eat code and take the bootcamp seriously, will I succeed in finding a programming career?

This decision came about because I feel like my life is currently on hold and I'm not really enjoying the theory behind pure Computer Science but definitely enjoy programming. I've also heavily relied on my parents and I would like to eventually repay them back and getting a junior web dev job would just do that.

I graduate this May with a major in Business Administration, and I won’t lie, it isn’t my passion. I was just getting a degree to get a job. I didn’t know what I wanted in my life. And now I do wish I could turn back time and change to a CS major— but no point in being regretful for the past. I didn’t know any better— I’ve never tried to code in my life! 

So, I guess I’m looking for input from people familiar with the tech/software engineering field. I can’t afford to take on more student loans and get another degree.  I checked— it would be another 2.5 years of school.
So, coding Bootcamps have been more favorable for me. But am I really signing myself up for heartache? Being tossed aside for someone with a CS degree even though I worked my ass off for my Business degree? Will I be stuck in startups making only 45k a year? Or do you think hard work will actually pay off in this field and skills are more favored? I don’t mind starting off with a crappy low paying  coding job at first—I just want to know if my hard work would actually pay off and that it’s worth it to put myself into more debt. 

Any advice is super appreciated :)"
codingbootcamp,How Freelancing Helped Me To Get a Software Engineering Position,1612226796," 

1. Know pair programming tools:    
In 2021, a lot of us has to work remotely and it wasn't a planned transition. One of the biggest challenges for software developers is to help out other team members. When we do pair programming, It's either they scroll too fast (so can't read), they closed a file (that we were just reading), or we got to dictating on what to type (takes time because we got to repeat it). But thanks to freelancing, you are forced to learn a lot of new tools to avoid the above problems. One of the tools that helped me with getting a job is to know how to use VS Code properly. Thankfully, it has one of the best plugins called ""Live Share"" that allows you to share your local environment with another developer so you can make changes directly in the source code. So if you get a question on the interview ""how would you pair a program with another developer"", don't forget about VS Code LiveShare technique. 

2. Wearing multiple hats:    
As a freelancer, you got to to be a project manager, a system architect (depending on the client work), writing code, testing the system, and a lot more. But how did this helped me? Well, when you are communicating with clients, they are none technical people who would say ""I don't know what JWT is and I don't think we need it as long as users can log in"". At this moment, you would have to find a way to explain using none technical terms why JWT is important. Something will happen during the interview. You will be talking to multiple non-tech people who will ask you simple technical questions and you will have to explain it using the terms they will understand.

3. Knowing relevant languages:    
At first, when I was searching for clients, I would make sure that I was able to use PHP, ReactJs, and MySQL/MongoDB. But with time, I wanted to expand myself to other languages and for more opportunities. So I started to learn &amp; use NodeJs for the backend, VueJs for the frontend, and Postgres for the database. When I started to look around for a full-time position, I had more options to where I could apply as I felt confident in using new skills. Also during the interview, I got a positive note from them saying ""you are using/have the experience in stacks that we are using in our applications"". So at the end of the day, it's not a bad idea to learn new languages but it has to be with purpose and making sure you will be using them every day (don't waste time on learning things you won't use).

I would say these are my top 3 points that helped me with getting a software engineering job. Would I stop freelancing? Not really, I will defiantly have fewer clients but I will still keep the ones I like.

codingbootcamp,I've been attending Springboard's Software Engineering Bootcamp since October 5th - AMA,1611960668,"I'm about 1/3rd of the way through this 800-hour long course, and can probably give people a fair assessment of what the course is like so far. Seems there's a decent number of people who are skeptical of the Bootcamp. Some of those skeptics will be skeptical regardless of what is said, but I'll try and be as objective as possible to any questions.   


Things to  note:  
1. My mentor in the course works for Shopify as a lead backend engineer.  We speak once a week and have been since the start of the course on October 5th. 

2. I've had multiple calls with career coaches. Typically at the end of every major career-centered unit in the course. 

3. I've done a number of fairly involved assessments and will begin working on my first capstone project here soon (Probably won't post my GitHub links)

4. I paid a $750 deposit to start the course after taking a sort of coding placement test. I am enrolled in deferred tuition with the job guarantee. 

5. I have taken one two week pause so far through the course.

codingbootcamp,Any good coding boot camps?,1611959388,"I swear I’ve been researching these boot camps and talking to them and trying to make up my mind and every time I think I’ve found one I like I read something about it that makes me question it. First off, let me start by saying that I know I can teach myself all this shit without the help of a boot camp. My wife however wants to see a more solid program at work with good outcomes for job placement she’s not gonna by the whole I’ll just teach it to myself. I’ve already been unemployed for too long and I need something to dive right in and help me learn it as fast as possible and I’m mostly paying for the structure, the accountability and the help. Now having said that, like I said..every time I think I’ve picked one some but of info makes me question myself. If you look on course report and switch up or whatever the other review website for these is all of them have a large portion of good reviews. If you look at the placement numbers for the major camps they are all pretty darn good. So I feel like me being a smart driven dude would be in these positive numbers, but sometimes you’ll read some bad reviews on Reddit or something that will make you question all the others, for example I had narrowed it down to 2 camps I am considering devcodecamp and codeup. But going on here and searching them up I found some negative reviews that made me question all the good I’d seen comments like ‘I read somewhere that codeup pays for good reviews’ and a review where codeup ‘didn’t come through on their job garauntee and bent the rules for it so they wouldn’t have to pay’...things for devcodecamp where they said the ‘instructor fell off in the second half of the camp and you were left to google everything’ or ‘they deliver the same sales pitch to everyone and let anyone in..they just care about the money.’ Things of that nature...and to be fair ALL of the ones I’ve talked to felt sales-y...and why not, of course they want you to join theirs and not another one... 

Are there any of these from anyone’s experience or knowledge that have a truly solid reputation? Should I just discount bad experiences based on a significant amount of good reviews found online? I just wanna find one that actually cares about the education and placement AS MUCH as they care about getting paid."

codingbootcamp,"Question: Bootcamp students &amp; aspiring developers, would you be interested in a newsletter going over core CS fundamentals?",1611894473,"Sorry if this isn't the most appropriate question for this sub, but thought I'd give it a shot.

At the last company I worked at, I've worked with a handful of self taught developers &amp; folks from bootcamps. For a lot of the folks that hadn't been in the industry for a while, I noticed that a lot of the computer science fundamentals were missing. This made it difficult for them to reason about specific types of problems (memory utilization, data races, concurrency, etc.) which makes sense since a lot of these bootcamps skew toward getting people up to speed on how to code without the emphasis on fundamentals.

Since we had a lot of newer devs joining from bootcamps, during my off hours, I worked on preparing materials to help bridge the divide. I got a hold of the bootcamp's curriculum, compared it to the classes that I had in my CS program, extracted the important takeaways I had from the core classes, and condensed them into slide decks. I started hosting fireside chats at work where I gave weekly hour long presentations to groups of recent bootcamp graduates. After concluding the fireside chats, the attendees all said that the material presented was valuable and applicable to their work.

Bootcamp grads &amp; current students, would you be interested in this content in a newsletter type style? The idea is to have a daily email that would go out that would go over the important aspects of the fundamentals in a presentable way.

If you're interested in more details, I've whipped up together a quick landing page here: [https://beyondthebootcamp.carrd.co/](https://beyondthebootcamp.carrd.co/)

codingbootcamp,Should I change coding bootcamps?,1611881123,"I (24F) am attending a free, local coding bootcamp. This bootcamp is a nonprofit and has advertised itself as a fullstack course.  


A little background, I graduated with an AA in Software Engineering in 2017 and a BA in English in December 2019. In the beginning of 2020, I was interning at a local school for Teaching English as a Second Language certification. When spring break hit and due to the virus starting to really spread in the USA, I was told to not come back. So, I finished my certification and I started to work 2 jobs.   


While working in my main job, I learned about a a free coding bootcamp through one of my old classmate's sister. She graduated from there and became a coding teacher within our county's school district.

I applied to the coding bootcamp and got in.

They never gave us a syllabi of what we were covering. Just to know that the course started in late July and will end in late July. So, a whole year. For anyone who wanted to hire us, they pitched that we would know HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, C#, CSS, etc. We don't even have career services that we can ask questions to nor do we have a good tutor that is always there. I have only heard from this ""tutor"" twice, the day she interviewed me for bootcamp and the day I asked for the program's provided laptop that I never got.

I was accepted into the program 2 weeks later than everyone else. There was one other person that came in at the same time too, but she is not the type to do her own work and just copy and pastes other people's work into her own. We'll call her ""Leach.""  


For 4 months, Leach and I had to play catch up to our other classmates. To this day, we are not fully caught up and the teacher made us skip some material in order for us to be at the same lecture with our other classmates. At one point, everyone in our class was given a kiosk project. All of us had to be paired up with a partner. All this time, I did my work and was willing to help Leach with whatever she had. However, she would just copy and paste my work as her own and would not understand almost anything that she had gotten down when asked to explain. She would even ask questions that were taught to us near at the very beginning and tried to get other people to fix it for her. There were many times that she would want to talk, as a friend, and would discuss about her life and would suck me and other people into her drama. It was so bad that she would describe illegal things in her life to other classmates and the owner/founder of the bootcamp had to call CPS on her since she is a minor. (Yes, she is still in the program.)

Anyways, I was paired up with Leach. Leach barely held up her end of the work. She copied and pasted a code/concept that the teacher hadn't taught us yet and used it as her own. Whenever her code crashed or not work, I would ask her to seriously attempt to fix it and to reach out to me when she figured it out. She didn't and I had to fix it for her.  


The day before presentation, she wanted to see my code. We got into it a little about how I need to always to send her updates to our code and that she should be allowed to edit my code. At one point, she convinced me to edit part of my code that practically made the entire project not work. I had to ask her to send my most updated copy to me since I couldn't work with our project anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Day of presentation, I present ""our"" work. The judges were impressed at the code and basically gave me the advice to not be afraid to ask for help. This is my biggest fear to this day since Leach has asked everyone in our class and our teacher for help even after the project.  


After our presentation, another pair had to present. Like me, this guy presented all of the work. However, it was obvious that his partner did nothing to contribute to their kiosk project. When everyone learned that this guy did all of the work, one of the judges SEVERLY scolded at the lazy student.

That day, no one was forced to leave the program.   


Today, I'm 6-7 months in the program. We did not get to do any front-end work and have only learned C# and Node. I am feeling overwhelmed/burnt out. Leach reaches out for me time to time for ""help"". I don't really have anyone who I can look to for help with code. I'll look to Google more than the others since not everyone is willing to help. I am fine with googling, but I also feel like I should be able to ask a question and have someone work with me for at least 15 minutes one-on-one whenever I really get stuck.

I love coding, but I wanted to do more stuff. I want to pursue a bootcamp that would be a better fit for me. Maybe something like Bloc or Lambda, coding bootcamps that will give me a stronger chance at finding a job as a web developer. I am still looking for other bootcamps that can help me achieve ultimate goal to be more of a front-end developer. I know this time, I'll most likely have to pay and I am willing to save up for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am grateful for the experience for it made me remember my original dream of becoming a developer. I don't know if my experience is reasonable enough to leave and I don't know if I am wrong to want to leave one bootcamp for another bootcamp. Do you think I am wrong for wanting to leave this bootcamp for another bootcamp?"
codingbootcamp,Recommendations for DACA recipients?,1611873661,"Hey guys,

I’m a woman of color, DACA recipient (DREAMER) originally from Mexico. I have been looking into a full stack/software engineering full time or part time bootcamp. I recently inquired about a scholarship at Galvanize part of Hack Reactor in Austin, TX, but the answer they gave me was ambiguous and frustrated me more that they could not give me a clear answer. They sent me a link to a scholarship that stated you must be a U.S citizen or permanent resident to apply. Not taking it personal, I’m sure they person who replied just doesn’t know much about DACA, which is fine. I’ve read of Lambda, and they are, to my  knowledge, DACA friendly.

Anyway, if there are any other suggestions or information thar anyone would like to share, please let me know.

App academy seems way more intense and I am a little intimidated by the grading system whereas you can be kicked out of the class for failing weekly tests. Obviously yielding better results as it seems more challenging. Thoughts?

Flatiron also has great job placement stats post boot camp so it seems it is still a great, thorough program. 

Any insight is helpful, thanks :)"
codingbootcamp,Unfortunate Experience at Codeup,1611761981,"I graduated from Codeup in 2020. The curriculum is great and the instructors were super helpful, but do not put too much faith into the placement team. Within the six months after graduation, I never received an “in-field” job offer. They’ll push your cohort to the side once a new class has graduated. Even though I attended every monthly meeting, met the number of weekly GitHub commits and weekly job applications, I felt I was passed up on better opportunities that were given to students who didn't push a single line of code since their Capstone. I remember an employee partner mentioning in an interview that Codeup was quick to provide a list of newer students to interview before mentioning anyone from previous cohorts.

Dimitri Antoniou (VP of Delivery) and the Codeup Placement Team falsely stated that I received an “in-field” job offer through the Codeup Apprentice Program. The program is a 3 month contract with an employee partner and if they feel that you’re a fit, they might extend an offer for a permanent role. It is not guaranteed that the company will extend an offer. I did not receive a verbal or written offer, instead I was sent an email from Gusto- a payroll service, and was pressured by Codeup to provide direct deposit information. Codeup promised an offer letter would be sent after I filled out the direct deposit form. I voiced my concern about seeing an offer letter first. Due to Codeup's constant pressure to fill out the form, I had to withdraw my application. 

Do not count on getting 100% of your tuition refunded if you end up without a job. I was only refunded 25% back and that was based on their false claims of receiving an offer. During my exit interview with the Placement Team, they were belligerent and condescending. If you withdraw from an application, Codeup will give you a partial refund because ""you were unwilling to work with the Placement Team"".

Whether you found the job on your own, used a local grant partner or if you took a job that isn't related to the Web Development field- the Codeup Placement Team will try to take credit to meet their quota of hired students."
codingbootcamp,Bootcamp without a degree?,1611650878,I'm currently 18 and going to community college. Just started my second semester and was planning to transfer to a real college after getting my basics out of the way. I was planning on getting a CS degree but I just wanted to explore my other options before I burn a bunch of money by going to college and spending the absurd tuition. What's it like being self-taught or going through just a boot camp with no degree? Is the job hunt impossible? I'm 100% confident this is what I want to do and am willing to put in the work. I also have heard that CS degrees go into some useless concepts and waste time. I'm also currently going through FreeCodeCamp. Any input you could have on this would be appreciated.

Hey there r/codingbootcamp , In October 2020 [I posted this](https://diamondcoder.com/best-algorithms-a-programmer-must-learn/) and you'll be seemed to like this. I have published this list you're about to see below on [diamondcoder.com](https://diamondcoder.com/) and it was very well received there. I am hoping you'll find some value in this as well. Full article is below and if you want more of this kind of thing then please visit [here](https://diamondcoder.com/) or you can follow me on reddit.  

**1.) Sorting :**

*(i) Insertion sort*

Insertion sort is the most simplest and easiest sorting algorithm to learn that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

**Algorithm**  
To sort an array of size n in ascending order:  
1: Iterate from arr\[1\] to arr\[n\] over the array.  
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.  
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

*(ii) Quick sort*

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and divides the array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in the different ways.

1. Always pick first element as pivot.
2. Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
3. Pick a random element as pivot.
4. Pick median as pivot.

The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.

*(iii)* *Merge sort*

Merge Sort is a [Divide and Conquer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-introduction/) algorithm. It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. **The merge() function** is used for merging two halves. The merge(arr, l, m, r) is key process that assumes that arr\[l..m\] and arr\[m+1..r\] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. 

The following diagram from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Merge_sort_algorithm_diagram.svg) shows the complete merge sort process for an example array {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10}. If we take a closer look at the diagram, we can see that the array is recursively divided in two halves till the size becomes 1. Once the size becomes 1, the merge processes comes into action and starts merging arrays back till the complete array is merged.

**2.) Binary Search:**

Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.

**Note : If you want to know about the** [Data structure](https://diamondcoder.com/data-structure-and-algorithm/) **which can make your programming experience awesome the** [Click here](https://diamondcoder.com/data-structure-and-algorithm/) 

**3.)** **Dynamic Programming :**

Disclaimer: This algorithm is most important to learn for the guys who are planning to ace coding competitions.

Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain [recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursion/). Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. For example, if we write simple recursive solution for [Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-nth-fibonacci-number/), we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems, time complexity reduces to linear.

**4.) Greedy Algorithm :**

A **greedy algorithm** is a simple, intuitive algorithms that is used in optimization problems. The algorithm makes the optimal choice at each step as it attempts to find the overall optimal way to solve the entire problem. Greedy algorithms are quite successful in some problems, such as [Huffman encoding](https://brilliant.org/wiki/huffman-encoding/) which is used to compress data, or [Dijkstra’s algorithm](https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/), which is used to find the shortest path through a graph.

However, in many problems, a greedy strategy does not produce an optimal solution. In the animation below, the greedy algorithm seeks to find the path with the largest sum. It does this by selecting the largest available number at each step. The greedy algorithm fails to find the largest sum, however, because it makes decisions based only on the information it has at any one step, without regard to the overall problem.

**5.) Hash function** :

A **hash function** is any [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) that can be used to map [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)) of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called *hash values*, *hash codes*, *digests*, or simply *hashes*. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a [*hash table*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table). Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called *hashing* or *scatter storage addressing*.

Hash functions and their associated hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval applications to access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval, and storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves. Hashing is a computationally and storage space efficient form of data access which avoids the non-linear access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys."

I would also greatly appreciate an suggestions for how to get started as an iOS developer, such as any boot camps that specialize in iOS, or any other paths that would lead to a job as an iOS developer.

codingbootcamp,Should I risk and go for the Bootcamp?,1611359537,"I am 31 now and trying to change careers. For past 10 years i've been working in the restaurant business(waiter/bartender/manager), but now I'm completely over it and want to switch to software engineering. I do have a Bachelor's Degree in Economics from other country(Ukraine) I also studied American college for 2 year (CS major), but had to drop it due to financial issues.

I've been to a few zoom info sessions and afterwards I'm like nah, that's not for me. Currently considering PDX Code Guild, Galvanize, We can code it, Code Immersives, among others.  One school claims to teach you how to think like a programmer while they teach you multiple languages. Others claim they will help you gain mastery in a single language.  Others claim they're committed to student success.  Etc Etc Etc. It seems like all of these schools teach Javascript.   Most of them throw in another language like Java or C# or Python.  Should I be concerned if it's just javascript or multiple languages?  Has anyone attended these schools?  I just don't want to waste my time."

codingbootcamp,Seeking some geat advice..,1611249546,"Quick backstory.. I've built a successful career as an audio engineer specializing in ""live"" touring concert production. I was at the peak of my career when covid hit last year, and we all had to pack everything up in March to sit and wait. Lots of very sad stories from other people in my industry. I had a bit of a unique situation, with my wife being pregnant and giving birth to our first child in September '20... big silver lining has been being able to spend time at home with her during her pregnancy and the spend time with our newborn, which im quickly realizing is an important thing in my life. I was expected to be traveling most of the year.

I've become serious during this time about doing a career pivot and have taken a lot of interest in coding. My initial spark was created a couple months ago from learning that the gaming industry is pretty big here in San Diego where we recently relocated to from Los Angeles. I love gaming and started poking around to see what sort of chances I could have at landing a job at Sony Interactive, or any other gaming studio in the area doing gaming audio related work. I have a friend that works at a smaller studio in LA, who highly recommended I start building my chops with Python as well as some middleware apps such as Fmod or Wwise to get my foot in the door. I started cracking down on this right away, and after a few weeks of more research and digging, I learned that the skills I already have from my ""music"" career wouldn't hold up as much as I initially thought in the gaming world. Seems to be more programmers who dabble in audio vs. the latter. I've also learned that salaries in gaming world are decent, but a step down from what I've been able to earn in my current industry (less than $100k/year). After realizing these things, I'm starting to think that spending at least a couple years of climbing back up a tall ladder only to land with less income than I'm currently making maybe isnt the right choice. During this time, I've come to a realization of the VAST expanse of the world of coding and how many different avenues and opportunities are out there.

During my short journey so far, I've realized that I really enjoy coding. Initially started with Python because of gaming, but am learning that Python is simply a great language to start on in general, and am thinking that I should go another direction with it. So now I'm back to scratching my head on what direction I should go towards with learning Python, and am hoping to learn more on the opportunities that are available. I've been doing codeacademy which has been great as well as udemy and a few other inexpensive online based courses. I've started to look into bootcamps and was recommended coding Dojo, which seems like a decent program.

\---

TLDR; Im simply looking for advice from experienced programmers/coders on what to do, based on my story. Whether it be continue to do the slow grind of teaching myself using online resources, or spend the money on doing a bootcamp. Also any advice on great Python resources or stories of other peoples journey and where Python has led you. My goal right now, is to be able to have a career with some stability and earn $80-100k to live comfortably and get to spend time at home with my growing family and find my inner happiness again!"

codingbootcamp,New to programming &amp; taking a Pirple HTML course: Project #1,1611201928,"New to programming &amp; taking a Pirple HTML course: Project #1                                                                                  Hey ""Redditors""! I'm taking an awesome HTML course on the Pirple platform and I thought I'd share my first project. The assignment is to make a page of my favorite story (in this case a Jack Reacher novel) and use 5 or more HTML tags and explain their use. I've learned how to use lists such as ordered and unordered, the proper use of links and images. I've also learned about Div tags and how they can be used to separate content in order to style them with CSS. The header, footer and Main tags help us organize and segment material properly as well. In a header we can add introductions and drop down menus. A footer can be used to close off information and optionally add copyright info, notes, etc. The main tag should contain the main portion of the web page's content. Article tags can also be used to segment specific written content.                                                                                                                                                                                                        For extra credit, I've added the form and input (text) tags in order to display a portion at the bottom of the page where the viewer can type in their name and email for the purpose of subscribing to an emailed newsletter.  Note: There isn't any backend code such as PHP to process the information. The break tags &lt;br/&gt; help with spacing and the meta tag helps with standardizing  characters  in the code. The iframe tag is one of my favorites because it helps us embed pictures, audio and video and has been the standard to add YouTube videos since 2015. The mark tag helps me highlight text in yellow while the block quote and cite tags form the perfect combination in order display a quote and cite its source. This comes in handy when displaying book reviews or famous sayings in general. In addition the figure and fig caption are another duo that allow an image to be displayed with a descriptive caption. This can be used for many purposes but has proven useful for scientific and art examples. My HTML code is written below for analysis.

codingbootcamp,Would there be any interest in a low-cost coding Bootcamp?,1611088444,"I'm curious as to anyone's opinions here. I've considered starting up a low-cost Bootcamp for probably $2,000 for a 10-12 week course. I know a lot of boot camps are around 10-12k, so I figured this would be a win for anyone looking to get real training without having to spend an arm and a leg.

I'm not soliciting for it, just trying to gauge what level of interest there is before I spend money on google ad words, etc. It would be online only and I'm thinking I would limit it to 10 students since it would be my first class and I don't want to overload myself. 

I wrote what was a #1 book (on amazon) on programming it's a category and I have some videos that are used by major universities already (the book is actually supplemental reading at a few universities as well). I've had multiple jobs outside of SV where I earned over 350k a year. So I think I'm pretty qualified as far as success goes.

In the last 8 years while working other jobs I trained 3 people with zero knowledge. They are making between 70-105k. I figured since I was already doing it for free with a good amount of success I might try starting a little business and get paid.

I can charge such low rates because (thankfully) I live cheap and I have enough to not need to work anymore. I just work on passion projects. 

I'm open to any opinions good/bad/ugly, just curious what people's take on this idea is.

codingbootcamp,3 things that could help Junior Developers to stand out during an interview (besides coding):,1610984006," 

1. Work on projects using version control: In professional settings, we use a version control system like git. It allows us to work on new features/code, whiteout touching the codebase. It means we have a master branch that contains production-ready code and you would branch out to work on a new feature. Let's say you need to implement a new button, you would branch out from master to write new code that would display a button. Once you are done writing the code, you would merge the code back to master, after it passed all the tests. So take a look at GitHub or GitLab and get familiar with basic commands like push, pull, merge, and commit. 
2. Have a basic understanding of agile development: There is a certain prosses set in place that helps companies to deliver software for their customers. In software development, we have a number of steps before the code can be released. We have a set of Requirements, Design, Development, Testing (Design, Development, and Testing is repeated till testing has been satisfied), and only after you can Deploy. This is something you probably can't really practice by yourself. But knowing this could increase your chances of getting a junior position.
3. Start getting familiar with task management tool(s): When you will be working with a team, you will have visibility on what your team is currently working on, what's been done, and what is coming up. Each task is assigned to one team member. Let's say you are working on a task and suddenly, you need to clarify if a JSON will contain a specific key:value pair. You could use a task management tool to find out who is working on that ticket, so you don't need to bother the entire team to answer your question. Overall it helps to get things done faster. So for practice, try to use some task management tool like Jira or Trello and separate your work into its appropriate tasks.

These are my top 3 pieces of advice that could help junior developers to stand out during the interview process. Sometimes it's not enough to rely only on the technical side especially when you are just starting out and still developing your skills.

Create a Java program that will allow the user to determine how many people were good and bad on Santa’s array.

NOTE: Set the size of the array to 5.

Sample input:        
good
good
bad
good
bad

Output:
This year for Christmas 3 people were good and 2 people were bad!
 
In the sample above, a For Loop will store the good and bad Strings as elements in an array. A second For Loop will then be used to compare each element in the array and keep count of how many there are of each.

IMPORTANT: The following line of code can inserted into a conditional statement to compare Strings:
array[i].equals(""good"")

Your program must include the following:
Scanner input in a For Loop for good and bad Strings into an array
For loop with conditional statements that determine the Strings as either good or bad
Output that states how many good and bad there are of each
Descriptive comments throughout the code

Bonus:

codingbootcamp,What advice would I give for new beginners in software development?,1610132650," 

1. Learn by repeating it:   
From the very beginning, I kept on redoing the work over and over again. Till I could explain it to others in a way they could understand. The reason why, it's because, by the time I get to the very end of a book, I would forget how functions or simple loops work. That did happen to me at first, I was not able to recall the knowledge. So I had to go back and reread the topic again. Use your time wisely and don't rush yourself. Keep covering the same topic multiple times till you get sick of it and reuse it in your next topic.
2. Successful developers learned their fundamentals:   
I have worked with a number of professionals and to this day, I still encounter developers that make mistakes because of not having a good understanding of fundamentals. I strongly encourage beginners from the very beginning, try to spend as much time as you need to understand the foundation as it will help you in the long term of your career. 
3. Practice by doing walkthroughs:   
The idea behind walkthroughs is for you to read some piece of code and identify the exacted output. Repeating this process weekly will help you to speed up your learning curve plus it will pinpoint what you still need to work on. For this part, I would recommend printing walkthroughs on a piece of paper and write the new value for each variable. If you get the same result as it was expected, that means you have mastered the material and you should proceed to the next material. 

These are my top 3 advice for new beginners in software development. This is something I was doing it and it helped me to become a software developer much faster with much fewer knowledge gaps. I hope this can help you to speed up your learning process or it gives you an idea of what you could do instead.

codingbootcamp,What advice would I give to new Junior Developers.,1609819867,"&amp;#x200B;

1. You don't need to know everything when you starting out:
   1. One of the things that I remember when I was a Junior Developer. I thought I had to know everything. But in reality, the expectation was how fast can I learn and can I work together with a team. Because when you are starting out, your seniors or supervisor will know that you are no expert and they would be giving you easy tasks that they know you can handle and learn from bit by bit. So don't forget, when you are starting out, focus on sharpening your skills and be a team member.
2. Learn how to break code apart:
   1. One of the major things in writing code is to learn how can you make it reusable. It sounds easy, but it's a bit tricky in practice. One of the books that I would recommend (I read it as a junior and it helped me to jump-start my career) and is to read clean code written by Robert Cecil Martin.
3. Last but not least, try to reference the docs:
   1. A lot of developers (who aren't even juniors) would search StackOverflow for the answer instead of going directly to the source. Copying and pasting the answer is not how you will get to the answer. Most of the time StackOverflow would have answers that are not best in practice. So when you write a new piece of code lest say using JavaScript, refer to the JavaScript document on how the specific function is working.

These are my top 3 pieces of advice to Juniors that helped me to progress in the tech world much faster and I hope that this will help you to advance your technical skills much faster as well.

I’m stuck between coding or getting a masters degree in something else. I’ve worked 2 jobs for the past few months and have saved up enough to cover the full expenses but need to get this right. So far I’m thinking of flatironschool’s self paced program. Do you think this would be suitable to possibly land me a job upon completion? I don’t need a high salary and would be ok with a 40-50k salary just getting my foot in the door, I also have no location preference so the entire continental US is fine as long as I can cover living expenses. Does this make any sense at all? I’ve also thought about the online part time program but not certain that my job schedule will be the same for 10months. As for a full time program, I think I’d only be interested if it were in person. It’s a major commitment either way and I was hoping to gain some insight especially about the reality of me being able to even find a job someday."

codingbootcamp,What tools do you need to know in order to deploy your first frontend application?,1609002496,"&amp;#x200B;

1. Need to have the right tools right from the start.

* If you want to develop a frontend web page, I would recommend using Visual Studio Code for building out websites. It's free to download and it simplifies complex workflows.
* You would also want to get familiar with Git version control. You will always have your code stored securely in the cloud and you will have access to it from any laptop (but you will have to login of course haha).
* Netlify is your biggest asset when it comes to running a static or dynamic website. It is free to use and it has amazing features for none paid accounts. It will generate a secure URL for your website and you won't have to worry about maintaining SSL keys.

2. You got to know what framework you are going to use for your frontend.

* You could build your frontend using VueJs, ReactJs, AngularJs, or any other JavaScript Framework that you are familiar with.
* If you want to make your UI look professional, then I would recommend using something like Tailwind, or Bootstrap.

As a frontend developer, you should also know and learn a bit about backend development.

1. I understand that your portfolio is what gets you a job, not which bootcamp you went to. Is that correct?

2. If so, would completing App Academy Open adequately prepare me for junior level jobs?

3. My plan after completing App Academy Open (or any curriculum) is to take up on some part-time projects before applying for full-time positions. Since I do not have any coding related things to put on my resume, I thought this would help me get a sense of the field and boost my resume. Will this be a sound approach to the job market?"

codingbootcamp,What to consider when thinking about going into software development.,1608484803,"Hey everyone!   


If you are completely new to coding, there are few things you have to consider when it comes to choosing a language and where do you want to be as a developer in a year or two.  


1. Have a road map:a
   1. The software development field has a massive choice of what you could do. You could be a web developer (frontend, backend, or fullstack). You could be creating different system applications for Windows or Mac. Then you could create apps for Android or Apple using different approaches. You could also do DevOps (a person who works with servers only) and a lot more. So when you go into software development, choose one aspect of programming that sounds like something you want to do and create a road map around it.
2. Remove all the distractions and focus on your main objective:
   1.  Let's say my main objective is to create PC video games. First I need to find out what language should I start with (let's say it's C (99% is it)). The next thing I should be doing is focusing on learning fundamentals and the theory of programming using C. The reason why we are starting with C, it's because it teaches all the basics of coding that you can apply in any programing language at ease. Also to create PC video games, you would use C++ that is build on top of C. So You are already seating yourself up on the right path without been distracted by any other language.
3. Use the right tools:
   1. For each programming language, we use a specific IDE that helps us (developers) to write software much faster and with fewer headaches. So to create PC video games, you would want to use Visual Studio. Because that is the tool that is been used by professionals to create system applications or PC video games.  


The only way you can succeed at something is only by planning ahead.

codingbootcamp,Highest Paying Programming Languages in 2021 You Should Learn,1608481784,[https://techbiason.com/highest-paying-programming-languages/](https://techbiason.com/highest-paying-programming-languages/)
codingbootcamp,ISA impact on my take-home pay,1608436852,"I wanted to give people an idea how the ISA really impacts your income. I thought it might be helpful while you are making your decisions. I have recently accepted my first engineering job, which will start next month. The job is within my current company, so that helps me more easily see how the ISA impacts my take home.

My current role is a tech support/customer service role, for which I earn $23.71/hr with a biweekly pay period (this annualizes to about $49K). During an average pay period, I gross $1897. After deductions (taxes, insurance, optional disability, HSA, etc) I take home about $1420 every two weeks.

My new role pays a salary of $90K. My gross pay per pay period will be $3462. After all of the regular deductions, this would net around $2450. After factoring in my ISA (17% of gross income for two years), I will be netting around $1830 every two weeks.

So, after factoring in the ISA, my $40K pay increase ($49K -&gt; $90K) will put an additional $888 a month in my pocket.

This is neither a criticism nor an endorsement of an ISA or any particular boot camp."

**Spam Detection using Machine Learning**

Describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. For example, if the probability that a incoming spam mail is related to the total presence of the word “Free”, using Bayes’ theorem the word “Free” can be used to more accurately assess the probability of a mail being spam than can be done without knowledge of the words within the mail.

codingbootcamp,"Christmas Code up Challenge, winners may get Apple Airpods Pro",1608055560,"Please read the following:

This is a 1 day competition. Anybody who would like to participate is welcome to participate. There is only one rule: have fun! There will be 3 programming questions, and the first 10 people who submit their solutions to my email will be entered for a lottery drawing. Questions will be sent to your email by 12/19/2020, my local time. We will send you the questions via Google Docs. You have to send your solutions to my email by 11:59:59pm PST on 12/19/2020 to be eligible for a lottery ticket.

&amp;#x200B;

Difficulty:

Due to the pandemic in the US, there haven't been a lot of coding challenges available this year. This is why I have decided to create this short and easy competition. These three problems are all very simple, it is all a matter of time, though. These problems are very easy, again, and they should only take an experienced coder about 8-15 minutes to solve each problem.

&amp;#x200B;

Prizes:

Each solution that passes the test data that I have gets a lottery ticket. The more correct solutions you have, the more lottery tickets you have.

The winner of the first drawing gets Apple Airpods Pro, and the second and third drawing gets 1 year of Disney+ and Discord Nitro Classic for a year, respectively. The fourth and fifth drawing will receive online certificates.

&amp;#x200B;

Other information:

My email will be in the google form after you sign up. In order to be eligible for a lottery ticket, you must send your solutions to my email using a txt file. Your solution must be in this format, or else you won't be eligible for a lottery ticket.

My partner(27F) and I(25F) are looking to make a career switch to software engineering/coding due to Covid-19. We both have college degrees and have professional experience working within our fields. 

We found the Revature boot camp program via Craigslist and applied. After some research, it looks like it's the one of the only camps that pays you while you are going through the program. This is especially helpful as we can't afford the more expensive programs rn. 

It looks pretty legit but I'm still skeptical. Does anyone have any experience (good or bad) with this camp and could offer some insight?"

Hello fellow coders! 

Unicorn Ninjas was created to teach programming terminology and design concepts without the need to stare at a screen. The game is played with 2 - 4 people and consists of two decks of cards, a “site” deck and an “elements” deck.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b1suzt9r8g261.png?width=2235&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b39c2a3fab15eb2ad4ceb9d1c390ca0d5b1e0b0

The element’s deck has cards with the name of various HTML elements (like “Button”, “Header”, “Input”, etc). Combinations of element cards are used to solve cards drawn from the Site Deck, and whichever Player solves it gains points. 

But there are a few twists! Players can attempt to bluff one another when solving a site, but at a risk! [Checkout the full rules on our Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unicornninjas/unicorn-ninjas-card-game-ignite-your-coding-spirit) **😃**

I have dabbled with Python at work, completed numerous CodeAcademy courses, read books, and plan to take the Harvard CS50 class on computer science. I’m working on developing a strong tech foundation regardless of a career change because it’s interesting and relevant in my current career. 

Does anyone have any advice on bootcamps and the Denver job market in tech? There’s so much conflicting information online.

codingbootcamp,Comparing bootcamps - importance of location?,1606694980,"Hello /r/coodingbootcamp!

I'm a total newbie (apart from a few months of self-study in HTML, CSS and JS) and am hoping to attend a coding bootcamp in the near future.  I have done a fair amount of research and believe, given my learning style and particulars in life, this would be the best course of action.  I'm also fairly certain that I'd prefer a part-time track (vs a full-time immersive and self-directed one) and, yes, I'm aware what you learn at bootcamp is widely available for free online.  I just need the structure and you might say the incentive to grind.  

That said, I'm kind of blown away by the cost!  I would gladly accept $10K but so many schools seem to be in the 15-20K area, especially in my area.  So, my question is:

Does the location of a bootcamp matter?  If I will be attending classes remotely anyways, is there some other reason to attend bootcamps in my area when it seems price is somewhat geographically dependent.  The only two reasons I can think of are connections in the area (I'm in NY) and improved quality due to the pool of instructors being deep here than, say, Tulsa.  That said, if I'm paying a school's rent and not benefitting from the environment of their campus, I feel like I may be foregoing on valuable savings.

There's also Plan B, which is going to a community college and later onto a university studying computer programming which will give me ample time for covid-19 to fade away and for me to dive deep in my studies for 4 years instead of briefly looking at content for 3 months. 

I know a big con for this is what they'll be teaching me (things that won't be needed in 4 years when I graduate), but I will and can happily code in my free time to create projects (what employers want) and get a solid education.

I went through their premium prep, their precourse, and I finally started the full-time 12-week immersive this week. I completed 5 days and had to drop. I felt really prepared but the pace is unmanageable for me. I even planned to do nothing but this for the next 3 months but after my 5th 16-hour day in a row, I just can't do it. Let me be clear, I have nothing bad to say about Hack Reactor, my experience so far has been great. I just don't think the accelerated pace matches my learning style. We have had about 25 lectures in 5 days...an unbelievable amount of material in just a few days. I feel like I can't even learn since I don't have any time whatsoever to absorb any of the material. We were expected to implement a linked list, tree, binary search tree, graph, hash table, set, stack, queue in the 5 JS instantiation patterns in about 10 hours total. I've never coded these things in my life and it just seemed like an impossible task for me in the time allotted. I feel completely worthless and defeated right now. I was so excited about this program and I just couldn't do it. I truly tried my best. There are just no words to describe how I'm feeling. I was laid off from my most recent job and I really needed this. I do have the option to do part-time but it's 9-months long and doesn't start until the end of January.

codingbootcamp,Does a coding bootcamp certificate actually matter?,1605901879,"I'm in a full-time trilogy bootcamp through a university near where I live (though entirely online). My instructor is great and the homeworks and projects are certainly great things to add to a portfolio.

That being said, the fulltime course requires 40 hours of work outside of the 25 in-class hours a week. The program is 12 weeks long. Between weeks 4-6 my girlfriend broke up with me, my mom's cancer returned, my uncle relapsed and then went into a vegetative state from an overdose and got put on life support for 3 weeks. In the middle of all of that my childhood bestfriend's girlfriend told me that in the 4 months I hadn't seen him he got raped and relapsed on his own addictions adding meth into the mix. I was the only one with his dad's contact info so I literally had to bail on a day of the Bootcamp to sit on a call for a few hours to explain to an adult's father that his son's girlfriend tried to end things with him while he was on a meth bender and he threatened to shoot himself with his mother's gun in a psychotic rage. Anyway, that happening in the middle of those 2 weeks on top of everything else resulted in a lot of missed work, especially since I live with my parents (both of which have bipolar, OCD, anxiety, and adult ADHD as well as having met in AA, they're quite fun people but very dramatic and LOUD and stuck at home) again due to the pandemic and neither of them understand that the bootcamp is real work and continue to utilize me as if I'm an unemployed high schooler on summer break (kind of tough to put your foot down on demands when your mom can't keep food down or hair in her scalp).

Anyway, I apologize for the therapy but I have a decent portfolio and am going to continue to add lots of great stuff to it now that I have the time. That said, I missed a few homework assignments and if you miss more than 2, you can't get the program certificate. I'm applying to universities in my state as I was studying electrical engineering out of state and decided against paying out of state tuition to half-ass circuit labs from my parents' garage while they're in the middle of a screaming match. Do you think not getting the certificate will prevent me from putting bootcamp student on job and college applications?"

codingbootcamp,Looking for a part-time LIVE online Data Science Bootcamp,1605021928,"Hello all,

I am looking to do a Data Science Bootcamp to advance my skills. I am a beginner in Python and intermediate in R. There are a ton of boot camps out there so I was hoping the Reddit community can point me in a good direction.

I am hoping for the following qualities in a Bootcamp:

1. Live lessons
2. Online (because of COVID)
3. part-time at night, around 3-6 months (min 3 months, max 8 months)
4. A course that isn't surface level but isn't quite like Flatiron (i.e 9-5 for 5 months)
5. Starting Jan or Feb
6. On the cheaper side (or the opportunity to apply for funding/ scholarships for women or underemployed people)
7. \*OPTIONAL - Geospatial component or project (I can also learn this on my own later)

I have found a few lesser-known boot camps that are on the cheaper side but thought I would reach out and utilize the Reddit community to see if anyone knows of any boot camps that fit the majority of my requirements.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
codingbootcamp,"Paid Apprenticeship Opportunity (technically remote, but Colorado &amp; Nebraska residents only)",1604967314,"I post about this here a LOT, particularly when people are asking if a bootcamp is worth it. This is a legitimate springboard into the industry. It's 3 months of 'bootcamp' style classroom and 3 months of supervised client work. 

After that, they try to hire people. They start around $65k. 

Paid experience is worth a lot more than paying for experience. You do not need previous experience, any degree, or other prereqs - but, that doesn't mean they won't be selective based on these factors. I fought that battle with them and lost a couple years ago. They really want 'diversity' they just don't quite understand what that means yet. 

Other than being a resident of one of the aforementioned states, here's the catch(es):

This is _not_ a perfect program by any stretch of the imagination. You can check out the glassdoor reviews, people are trying to be honest. One of the problems people run into is they think they're going to be employed by Techtonic in the long term. This is definitely where you will be greatly disappointed. They just aren't equipped for that and management has a hard time admitting it. There's a handful of permanent roles, no matter WHAT the CEO says about 'room for advancement' they do mass, periodic layoffs. 

I strongly advise anyone who gets into this program to start looking for a new job at the six month mark (or sooner) regardless of how your prospects look inside Techtonic. People really like it there, and they try to keep everyone - which leads to inevitable, periodic layoffs. Stay employed while you seek other work, but seek other work. They will also try to contract you out - it's totally fine to take that contract, they hire out to some _great_ area companies (SomaLogic, IHS Markit to name a couple)."

codingbootcamp,I'm getting burnt out. Anyone have any advice?,1604900564,"Hi all, student in Thinkful's PT Software Engineering bootcamp here.  I could use some advice if anyone can help!

Specifically, I'm getting hit by burnout HARD.  My plan was to do a PT self-paced program but work full-time to graduate as soon as possible.  In the first 5 weeks this went great and I actually finished an amount of work that I was scheduled to have spent 8-9 weeks on.  But then in early October, things slowed down.  I'm not behind schedule but I've lost a lot of that buffer I built up.  I'm having a hard time holding myself to do work day-in day-out and feel like I'm alternating periods of slacking/catch-up.

Granted, some of the issues are outside of my control.  One problem is that I've kept designing projects that are more complex than I realize, and then I'll hit a wall and not be able to make progress for a day or two until meeting with my mentor to get an impromptu lesson on how to solve it.  Still, the frustrations are real even if I know they're outside of my control.

I've discussed this with my therapist and she thinks I'm having issues with burnout.  And honestly, she isn't wrong.  I really think what's happening is the emotional gas tanks are getting empty and instead of crashing and burning, I'm slowing down to a more sustainable pace.  The problem is that already being at the end of my energy, that's not very productive.  In September I did 60-70 hour weeks coding and legit got as much work done as that sounds like.  From mid-October to now I've been working 30-40 hours a week and honestly getting about as much work done as SHOULD take 20-ish hours.

Now I know what someone's going to say- I may be learning now that this isn't the right career for me.  As background, I haven't had a vacation in about a year and a half.  The job that laid me off at the end of July I regularly worked 65 hour weeks at (salaried).  And learning/programming is a LOT less stressful than that career was.  I really feel like I'm just at the maximum amount of time that I can go without a break and keep my mental health.

That said, hearing horror stories about the job market right now is scary.  I really feel that if I want a future in this career, I need to get through my program as fast as I can, learning as much as I can, and entering the job market as soon as I can.  I really worry that every week I wait could be another week that a job which would have been perfect for me goes to someone else.  I feel irresponsible taking time off now, especially when unemployed (though my wife makes good money so we're doing ok).

On an objective basis I know this is a no-brainer.  My program allows up to two weeks of LOA for any reason (more with a reason) so I can 100% access it.  And I know that giving myself some time away to finish deferred housework, smoke some ribs, play some video games, and decorate for the holidays will do me good.  But I also feel like I'm having a hard time giving myself permission to step away for a week.  All my anxieties about starting my new career successfully are coming up and I worry that if I take time off I'll spend the entire time thinking about how I should be getting more work done to stay on schedule.  And an anxiety-ridden vacation might as well not be a vacation.

Can anyone share some productive thoughts?"

codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp and Petroleum Engineering Degree,1604465021,"Hey everyone so I’m looking to change careers or at the very, very least enhance my skill set for my current career. I would like advice on what coding Bootcamp any of you would recommend for a beginner in my position. 

For some background, I received my BS in Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering from West Virginia University in 2017. I have zero coding experience. Since graduating, most of my career experience has been Mechanical Engineering in the realm of oil and gas surface facilities (just laid off as of 10/31/2020). I’ve worked about 3 years in upstream O&amp;G engineering roles, and my favorite part of my experiences so far was helping programmers develop a new Human Machine Interface (HMI) for one of our facilities. I got into researching some coding bootcamps at that time about a year and a half ago but never had time to enroll. Now that I’m laid off I from work, I feel like it’s a perfect time to invest in myself and possibly make a career change. I do like working in oil and gas, but I feel that there’s writing on the wall to leave the industry now while I’m 25 rather than later when I’m 40 with kids and no career lol (this discussion is for another thread I’m sure haha). 

I understand that coding is not easy, as is nothing else worth while in life. I’m up to a challenge, love learning new skills, enjoy learning from people with different backgrounds, and have high expectations for myself. I’d like your full and raw thought for the following questions/concerns.

1) What bootcamp did you finish?

2) What bootcamps would you recommend and why?

3) What prep material should I use? I’m starting Flatiron’s free prep course tomorrow. 

4) During the Bootcamp, what resources are best to help me along the way?

5) What all do I need to prepare or do before beginning my work search upon bootcamp completion?

6) How are random disciplined engineers viewed in the CS/developer world? I assume that these recruiters give zero f**ks about my Petroleum Engineering degree and very little about my mechanical engineering experience lol. Is this a correct assumption?

Thanks in advance, I hope everyone is doing well."

codingbootcamp,Is a bootcamp worth it? Any recommendations?,1603834332," 

Hi,

So this might become a little long but if anyone takes the time to read it I appreciate it. But if not, np, heres a tl;dr - have basic programming experience, want to take a bootcamp so i can learn, not for an immediate job. any reccomendations?

I am currently a freshman at the University of Washington, undeclared as a major as I wanted to keep my options open. However, I'm finding that I do not really enjoy anything other than computer science and want to major in it. I have been coding since sophomore year of high school, and have a around a beginners level of knowledge in Java, LISP, js, html and css(though it's been a while), and am teaching myself python.

In high school, I was almost always extremely frustrated with my classes as I wasn't really learning anything. I was learning things for a grade, which I despised. I'd learn whatever Chemistry I needed to to pass the test, and that was it. I was really hoping that college would change that, but I'm 5 weeks in and it's the exact same. I'm taking 2 intro to computer science classes(since I'm undeclared as a major I have to start here) covering material that I already know, and 2 classes that don't fulfill any major requirements but I thought would be fun, but are still just short-term memorizing things to pass the class.

What I'm considering is dropping the 2 ""for-fun"" classes I took, and picking up a cs boot-camp outside of school instead. My reasoning for this is that I want something to do with my day. I feel useless just slogging through mindless work 24/7, and I want to learn something again. I'd probably have to take a from-scratch bootcamp if I did, which I am totally okay with. Money also isn't an issue at all, as if I dropped my classes I'd get a HEFTY chunk of tuition back.

If you've read this far, thank you so much! If you have any experience or recommendations for a coding bootcamp I would really appreciate it. I don't like front-end at all, and I wouldnt be doing it expecting/wanting a job on the other end. I just want to learn for myself."
codingbootcamp,Asking for a discount on in-person bootcamp after going remote from COVID?,1603831513,"Hello, I attended an in-person bootcamp in San Francisco in March. 2 weeks into the program, the school switched to all remote learning due to Covid. Obviously there was no way around this for the school. 

However, when deciding on doing this bootcamp I specifically chose it for the in person learning and only signed up with the expectation that I would be learning in a classroom. I even moved cross-country in order to attend this bootcamp in person. If I had wanted to do it remotely, I had other options which were SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than the in person one. I had reasoned with myself that in-person learning was worth the pay increase for me. 

Do you think it's reasonable to ask the bootcamp for some sort of payment reduction? If so, how do you think I should go about it? My gut tells me that it doesn't hurt to at least try."

I've been working at the same place for 6 years. I find the culture of the entire industry to be toxic and I feel that people are generally underpaid, myself included. I have a bachelors of science in engineering from a top 50 school and a masters degree in mechanical engineering from a top 10 school. I also have the debt to prove it! My only experience with coding is with Matlab which I excelled in and enjoyed in college, but I've already dismissed this experience as irrelevant to a real coding carreer as it doesn't seem to be ""true"" coding in any practical way.

I'm not interested in hearing about how you can ""get more for free at codeacademy"" etc... I'm prepared to go all in on a coding bootcamp. Doing some coding classes on the side with nothing tangible to show for at the end of the road just doesn't give me the insurance I would need to quit my job and give up my hard earned reputation and skill set.

What I'm looking for is some information on what I can reasonably expect as a job seeker from a highly technical background with credible prior employer references (from a different field) and good education credentials (also from a different but still technical field), and a certificate from a good coding bootcamp...

codingbootcamp,Quality of bootcamp alternatives,1602615404,"Hey guys,

I signed up for full stack University of Washingtons bootcamp, paid the deposit and reserved the seat. After a little digging, which I should have done before, I found that it was not a good choice for me. Turns out it was actually Trilogy running the camp with UW logo slapped on everything. Saw enough information about them to decide that's not who I wanted to give 13k to. Their website uses wordpress ffs lol! Got my deposit back thankfully. 

Anyway I've been searching around and it looks like they're all pretty aggressive in terms of trying to get you in a spot and rush you through it. I understand it's supposed to be rigorous but I worry about what happens if I truly struggle in one area. I'd have to retake a section, forfeit career services by doing so and/or pray there isn't a gap in knowledge that will show during an interview. I liked the idea of going for one with an ISA for some sort of job placement guarantee but am thinking that's not worth paying 1.5x the amount in the long run just for a job. 10-17%% of your gross income up to $30k for 3 years? For 3-6 months of education? That's more steep than a traditional student loan, at least in my experience.

I am thinking about just doing the treehouse tech degree or NuCamp bootcamp which are both under 2k for 5 months of curriculum just so that I can stay on track and be paced by something. I honestly don't care about the certs they give you because well, neither do employers. I just need something to keep me working consistently, like a job would. I'm something of a procrastinator when it comes to self teaching. I've realized at the end of the day it really boils down to your portfolio anyway and not the ""prestige"" of a bootcamp slapped on your resume. Anyone have experience doing this much cheaper hybrid route? Will I really be missing out on much other than the networking possibilities and ""career services""? 

I'm sure there are thousands that have had great experiences with bootcamps and I'm not knocking that at all. I know you worked your tail off! Just not worth the investment for me. Any and all input is what I'm looking for! Thanks guys!"

The first test was all logic with basic coding questions. Is the second test more logic, or well-rounded coding questions? I am worried I will not be ready for the second test even though I scored 12/12 on the first test.

My second question is if anyone has had experience with TechElevator . Is the job placement rate acceptable? Is the course taught by pairing students? I would rather have an instructor.

I'm looking to operate my business at the same time as learning to code (or at least somewhat since I have some projects). I don't know much coding but eventually would want to be able to build a site with some back end development and front-end development.  


I would basically want to be able to make a project like this. I realize this is a HUGE project with most likely a ton of developers in multiple areas, [Project](https://www.llt-group.com/work/branding-design-and-software-for-a-food-delivery-service/). I am more interested in the Sign Up Screen, Restaurant Portal, Driver Mobile App. This has a lot of different features.

Usually I would just take some udemy courses. In this case I don't want the money to expire. I thought a course of a big known unversity would be good in the vita. But maybe there are some other courses filling the gap between 10$ udemy course and 5,000$-15,000$ ""offline"" coding bootcamps.

I've tried things on and off like odin project, free code camp, app academy's free curriculum; and I for sure love programming and feel I can be good at it. I'm currently unemployed (quit amazon warehouse job because it just became too dangerous due to covid) with zero prospects of landing anything video related.

Bootcamps seem to be my best bet but my concern is how do I know I'm picking the right bootcamp? How do I get rid of this looming fear that it might just be another waste of time?

I'll be graduating at the end of this year. I attend a top tier university, but the job market for typical grads in my field has been affected and I'm unsure if I'll be able to procure employment. I'm honestly wishing I had chosen to study CS, as I love data analysis and problem-solving. I've taught myself some python so far, which I've enjoyed and taken onto nicely, and feel this realization has come too late.

My college major is Earth and Environmental Sciences. I've really enjoyed the coursework which has involved a lot of analyzing and interpreting data(only through excel, however). I feel the Bootcamp would be a nice fit to fill in my gaps in coding and programming literacy. I'm unsure of if I'll be able to procure a decent job straight after graduating(especially with the current situation), which would provide the perfect opportunity to do a boot camp. The lifestyle of a programmer/software engineer fits me very well, especially with the widespread possibilities for remote work.

**My question is:** Does anyone have any insight into the work prospects of those who do a Bootcamp following college graduation, compared with people who studied CS?

Additionally, is internship experience in the field generally required to procure a position? I have work experience, but not in anything computer-related.

codingbootcamp,Tuition Guarantee Voided,1598623418,"I enrolled in a bootcamp in February. Now I am nearly finished. As part of the bootcamp there are some tests. I took the most recent test and failed it by one point with the grader remarking that it was close, but they thought I would benefit from a retake. Three weeks later, I take the test again, this time failing by 6 points. I reach out to the bootcamp and I explain that I don't think the grading was fair, and that I need a retake. I am later told that because I failed twice, my Tuition Guarantee and Career Assistance are cancelled, acknowledging that there may be some discrepancy in grading rubric. I have paid all of my tuition and I am nearly finished, and this is my outcome. I am trying to contest it, as I believe I was wrongly failed. 

I believe my score was artificially low for many questions. Questions I know I answered correctly but received little credit for. I believe they have purposefully failed me, as during the pandemic, jobs may be hard to come by, as a means of not honoring my tuition guarantee, which is a 100% refund in the event that I don't find a job within 6 months.

I've tried watching YouTube tutorials to no avail.. We are on our first project this week and I am stuck, I had to have an instructor basically walk me thru everything I've done. I can't really do anything on my own at this point. 

I was simply looking for a career change and one of my friends suggested I check into this, I did the interview projects and had a lot of fun (that was CSS and HTML, and a lot of it was heavily guided by the website). Now that we are on JS and databases I am kind of realizing I am in over my head.

codingbootcamp,Update: Choosing Direction of Study. Treehouse versus Nucamp,1598223205,"During my last post, I got a lot of negative feedback about bootcamp. This effectively made me question my choice to go through General Assembly’s Immersion Program. 

I can’t say I won’t rule that out forever, but I’m going to try some other options first. Spending my time self-teaching and using Udemy is one of them.

However, I’m very intrigued by Treehouse, and I’m thinking of giving that a go. I also received a lot of suggestions for Nucamp too.

We’ll see if I get talked away again. 😅 I definitely over analyze my choices."

I’m very passionate about coding, and I just want some structure to learn how to do it — to prepare me for a job.

codingbootcamp,Value of Lambda School Full Stack Web for non-beginner,1598133844,"As someone who is an admittedly non-beginner, but with plenty of holes in their knowledge, I’m wondering if attending the Full Stack Web course would be worth the time and financial commitment.

A little background... I was a CS student who dropped out after a couple years and worked as a sysadmin since ‘08. In ‘17-‘18 I decided to attend a local coding boot camp. It was a 3mo course that covered Python/Django, JS/jQuery and HTML/CSS. The curriculum was a bit dated, but I did well and didn’t have much trouble completing the projects. It wasn’t until I started looking for jobs and internships that I realized how little the course taught (I was stumped by basic Q’s about OOP, like the difference between a class and an object). 

Wound up applying to almost anything related to software engineering including QA and TSE positions (which didn’t exactly thrill me). I did manage to get two QA analyst positions in the last couple years, one testing server side APIs and another testing a major iOS and Android app. COVID-19 hit and I got laid off back in July. I’ve had a lot of difficulty finding any QA positions and realized I’d really rather get back into web development.

Which brings me to my current dilemma. I want to strengthen my skills to get a position as a web/software engineer. Should I:

A) Pick up some tutorials (FreeCodeCamp, Wes Bos, Full Stack Open 2020...) to get better at JS, learn React and pick up some algorithm/data structure fundamentals. Then try to flesh out a new portfolio and try to find a job on my own.

B) Attend Lambda School Full Stack, which should cover everything I need.

While option A is obviously cheaper, I know it will be tougher for me to do this on my own without the structure and social aspect of working with others and having someone to look to when I have blocking issues. I also feel like option B may provide better assistance in creating a portfolio and tracking down a first job.  To me that seems like it will be worth the cost and time, but I have some doubts still.

tl;dr: Have some CS/IT background, attended a local code school a couple years ago and didn’t learn enough, wound up working as a QA tester and recently laid off. Really want a job as a web/software engineer. Not sure if Lambda School is worth the time/money or if I should just do some tutorials, make a new portfolio on my own."

codingbootcamp,AITA - Did I accept offer too soon?,1597954955,"This is a throw away account.

Has anyone received an offer of employment for another company you interviewed after accepting an offer from an employer that sent first? I'm in this situation.

I am a bootcamp graduate, non-CS, non-degree and have received an offer for one of the big consulting firm's year-long apprenticeship for a very low starting wage. They will be working with cloud migrations and more backend development which I think is would be great learning experience and resume builder, but I'm afraid that it may be too difficult during these crazy times we live in to survive for a year on that wage without having to work a second job on top of that, which would likely be impossible due to the strenuous training that takes place over that year.

I completed my third interview yesterday with a 3 year old start up in the healthcare industry and I expect to get an offer from them as well for almost double what the offer from the consulting firm was.  The role I interviewed for was a product support engineer. Mostly troubleshooting/resolving client issues with ""our"" software. They are looking to expand rapidly over the next year after major client acquisition. This start up also pays 100% for healthcare, has barber/chef on site, beer on tap, condo in FL for vacationing employees, unlimited PTO, and 401k matching of course. I think the final interview went very well and I expect good news from regarding the result.

I also just received an email notification that I am being offered a test engineer position with a large financial institution in the Midwest, and that was for double the offer from the consulting firm as well. The only downfall to this one is that I would have to relocate (probably not until COVID chaos has subsided).

All of that said, I am trying to keep my head afloat after taking out a loan for the bootcamp, which I will have to start paying back in December at $300/mo. I'm in my mid-30's, I do not have a spouse or kids, other than two dogs. I am currently in a 15-month lease that finishes at the end of April 2021. I have basically used up the money I had saved (as planned since before the bootcamp) to hold me through the job search, but COVID has exacerbated any difficulties that I had anticipated. Anyway, what would you all do in my situation? Stick with the first offer that I accepted hastily out of fear I will miss out on the only job offering me money before the offer expires, accept the offer from the financial institution and think nothing of cancelling the acceptance of the first offer, or wait for the offer from the start up to make a final decision on which of the three I should pursue?"

codingbootcamp,Advice on How to Start a Career in Coding,1597933607,"Hi guys,

I'm looking for some advice in how to begin a career in coding. When lockdown restrictions were put in place in March, I along with quite a few people were placed on furlough and I found a free beginners course in web development that I took part in. 
   I had never attempted to code before and this course taught me a few basics in HTML, CSS and JavaScript allowing me to reach the end goal of making an interactive website from scratch (quite a thrill considering I had no idea how to do this before!)
   After five months on furlough, I got the news that I have been made redundant from my job. The good news is that I will receive redundancy pay so I'm good for a little while as I find a new position. After my beginners course I started the FreeCodeCamp course  and I have been ploughing through that these last few months, during this time I've realised one thing - I absolutely love learning how to code!
   Now I don't want to just accept whatever job comes my way next and then continue on this cycle of working my butt off in a job that I'm unhappy in and is non-rewarding. I've looked in to a few courses here in the UK that often start at £5,000+, but as I look into the description of said course, it's basically going to be teaching me everything that the FreeCodeCamp is doing.
    Would anyone be able to give me some advice on how I can start on the path of making coding my career? Am I best to pay for a bootcamp for that additional help in finding a career afterwards, or should I apply for internships etc? Just genuinely curious how others started their career.  As I say, I'm fairly new to it all - just learning more about JavaScript just now, a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS and I've still yet to start my Python course.
    I'm hoping to learn and complete as much as I can to obtain the certificates of completion which will hopefully help with taken the steps towards new employment in the near future. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!! (:"

codingbootcamp,Bootcamp worth it if parents offer to pay?,1597771915,"So I have a bachelors in chemistry from a really good school here in California and honestly.... I hate it.

Every job I’ve had out of college so far I was expected to work about 12-15 hours a day slaving away in the lab with no over time making only 40k a year. Meanwhile I have friends in finance who have work parties every week and get drunk in their offices regularly making double that. 

Currently I’m unemployed and had to move back home and due to the recession. My dad knows I was planning on going back to school to get a masters but he agrees with me, I’m paid absolutely shit in my field and need to get out. So he offered to enroll me in a data science bootcamp. I don’t want him to feel as though he wasted his money so I’m wondering would it be worth it to do the bootcamp now, try to break into the field of data science/ data analyst and then go back to school for my masters once I have some good work experience? I know I can learn this on my own but the bootcamp im eyeing has job assistance help and claims 93% of students find a job within 6 months"

I want to get ahead but the concepts are getting more difficult and I work 60 hours at a bookkeeping job besides this for right now! I started out in June with front-end topics, and I've gotten all these front-end topics down like html, css, javascript. The boot camp is 6 months long. At the very beginning, I was able to keep up on html, css, bootstrap, easily. That was for about the first two weeks or so. Then when we got to JavaScript, I started falling behind because I wasn't keeping up and I had to rewatch lectures and do in-class stuff outside of class. Then we got to jQuery and Ajax and I got more used to having to catch up and doing homework slowly while needing help! Then like we did our project 1, a group project, where I really failed to keep up and discovered communication problems and all this all that! I used some front-end stuff, but I really didn't do much! Now I feel like I'm just kind of just barely learned front-end stuff and didn't put enoughhhhhhhhhh effort into it, and we're on BACK-END now!!! We have done node js asynchronous constructors and everything! I am falling even more behind!

Since it is the second part (back end) of the boot camp now I have to really start being more self-controlled and working harder but I'm falling behind! I'm looking at having finished two months of the bootcamp, learned front-end, and you know spending two months on it already and stuff..... I am falling behind now! Later on when we get to full stack like with React and stuff it will get even more difficult! I can't control myself enough to sleep enough at night sometimes, and I'm also dealing with other minor health problems that require my attention.......... I need to do better and I have to do better before it gets even harder! I also deal with acne, and that requires my attention.

codingbootcamp,Looking for former App Academy students for an article on ComputerScience.org,1596665108,"Crossposting on r/coding as well, so apologies if you see this twice. 

I'm a freelance writer (new to Reddit!) and I'm creating a profile and program review for App Academy on [ComputerScience.org](https://ComputerScience.org). App Academy is the first in a series of coding bootcamp profiles we'll be working on. 

For the profile, I'm looking for one to three former App Academy students to provide a quick testimonial about your experience. These will be featured on the App Academy profile to help future students make a decision about which program to choose.

What I need:

\- Student Name

\- Course 

\- Year Enrolled

\- 100 to 250 words summarizing a review of the program. How did you choose the program? What was the admissions process like? What did you like about the program? What could have been better? Would you recommend it to a friend?

Thank you! You can DM me your replies, or post questions/comments here."
codingbootcamp,I'm stuck : Can someone explain me how this would be learned ?,1596658592,"How should I learn programming in a good amount of time ?
I'm coming up with this question because I'm like stuck in a loop where I can't learn It anymore ....
I started with a YouTube course for Python , I had to leave coding for a while , and then I tried to write it on paper , but now when I'm like repeating from paper I'm like either falling asleep/loosing interest quickly...
So , the question is :""How should programming actually learn , and repeated ? "" Is it from writing it a few times more on the keyboard ? Or is it writing it down on paper ? Is it just reading it from the screen (that seems more exciting for me) 
Ps: I've seen results with both methods , on pc i was just .. faster . And i also read that writing it on paper was used in 1950's"

codingbootcamp,Middle aged woman with PhD in non-tech field looking to get into a coding career: a case for boot camps?,1596425961,"First of all, apologies for having posted a similar thread on a related sub.

I'm a 32 year old woman in the rural Midwest, with a PhD in communication and seven years of experience as a university instructor (and two of those as a professor), but no formal coding experience. I actually wanted to do a coding career before I decided to go into liberal arts academia; I wasted a decade and most of my friends who are in coding are happy and successful, living in cities. Where I'm at I can't even network with anyone, and getting back into academia is basically impossible once you're ""off track.""

So, I'm shall we say euphemistically between jobs and have essentially infinite time. Also infinite motivation. I want to start the career I should have over ten years ago and do it before I get too ancient. I'm not able to take on further student debt for a degree, but I do have savings (and a stable living situation, thanks to family support) - so, if a coding boot camp would help, I would do it. I want to try to begin a software development career as soon as I possibly can, and I hate my life where I'm at enough that I'm willing to devote basically every waking moment to it.

I'm quite aware that all these resources are available for free online. I also have friends who can help me work though code problems. However, I'm concerned about job placement. Even if I build a portfolio on my own through self-teaching, since I live in nowhere, and want to relocate to a major city, I'm worried without some kind of tech related credential (I can claim some stats knowledge with my PhD but not a large amount) I will just be ignored, especially as an older woman applying for jobs in places I'm not known.

So, based on all of this, is a coding boot camp ""worth it""? Are there coding boot camps that maybe have a better reputation for helping people find placement than they do in curriculum? 

If coding bootcamps are (as it seems like the consensus of this sub is) worthless, are there alternatives besides luck for building the kind of professional network one needs to get a junior developer position? Obviously, I know LinkedIn skills and other social media are important, but again, something tells me that alone won't get me hired.

Again, I basically feel like I'm dying going nowhere in my life. I know coding is what I want to do, and I'm willing to spend money for it - if it'll help. I know that going back to school for a CS degree like I should have done years ago is probably the theoretical ideal, but I just don't feel I have the time left in my life to pull that off."

codingbootcamp,Job guaranteed bootcamps,1595979271,"So here is a question I have been asking for myself for a couple months now. 

Are “job guaranteed” bootcamps worth it?

I am currently looking at a program through a local university which goes through trilogy. They don’t guarantee a job after you graduate but other bootcamps do. The program I am looking at is 10K can be paid upfront (9K after 1K discount) or it can be paid monthly roughly 1500 a month after a 1K initial payment. 

Other bootcamps have ISAs which seem nice but at the end of the day you end up paying over 20K for most.  

I am wondering if anyone on here has done a job guaranteed Bootcamp. Was it worth it? Do they actually help with job search or is it just a marketing tool?

All feedback is appreciated. Thanks for helping me through picking the right Bootcamp for me!"

I need the form to be 600px wide when the screen is greater than or equal to 600 px wide, use a grid layout to layout labels and form elements when the screen is greater than or equal to 600 pixels wide, is the width of the screen when the screen is less than 600 pixels wide and lay out the labels and form elements as full width when the screen is less than 600 pixels wide. Here is what I have so far leaving out styling stuff like font/aligning the names:

form {

/\* Center the form on the page. \*/

margin: 0 auto;

width: 600px;

@ media screen and (max-width: 600px) {

/\* removes width from form so that

it is just as wide as the screen \*/

form {

width: auto;

}

/\* Turn labels into blocks to stretch across

entire screen \*/

label {

display: block;

margin: 0;

text-align: left;

width: auto;

}

/\* Let the inputs, textareas and selects span

input,

select,

I already have a STEM degree so any coding would be helpful even within my field but the possibility of jumping to a full on web developer role is also a possibility with these camps it seems. I live near toronto so I have been looking at Lighthouse Labs, Juno, GA, Brainstation etc. But considering its going to be online anyway there could be others idk about that are even better since i'm not restricted geographically. I am leaning towards GA but honestly if I'm going to drop more than 10 k on something I want it to be the best possible one so what kind of criteria should i look for for a bootcamp. Also how much of a negative impact is there in having to do these bootcamps online vs in person, I imagine a lot of the networking is in person and that would be a big part of why these camps are highly valued right? Also I see a lot of people recommend Juno/HackerYou but their program is only front end so is it wise to only limit yourself to front end if your going to spend this much money anyway? Any insights in helping me make a decision would be most helpful"

codingbootcamp,"The Impact Scholarship for BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and womxn identifying individuals",1595358996,"This scholarship is focused on our commitment to diversifying the tech industry by offering discounted tuition to students affected by systemic barriers and widespread injustice. Burlington Code Academy believes that by providing this scholarship to BIPOC, LGBTQ+ and womxn identifying students, we can empower the future faces of tech, in turn demanding a more diverse and inclusive industry. 

**BIPOC:** The tech industry is host to a predominantly white workforce, [statistics](https://www.eeoc.gov/special-report/diversity-high-tech) showing that 69% of tech employees are white, while made up of only 8% Latinx people and 7% Black individuals.

**Womxn:** Historically, the tech industry has been dominated by men. For example, [Only 26% of computing jobs are held by women. This number has been on a steady decline for years.](https://techjury.net/stats-about/women-in-technology/#gref) Bootcamps offer some long overdue solutions to these problems of inequity; while women only make up 18% of Computer Science graduates, 35% of bootcampers are women. 

**LGBTQ+:** While an [estimated 10 million Americans identify as LGBTQ](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/state-of-women-in-tech/), tech industry roles do not reflect this. Although many companies have implemented LGBTQ+ inclusion policies[, few numbers in these groups are reaching the top levels of these companies.](https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/state-of-women-in-tech/) 

*The issue is not and has never been lack of talent*, but instead a lack of access and equal representation in the workplace. 

That is why we have committed $50,000 to our Diversity Initiative, which directly funds our Impact Scholarship. The Impact Scholarship provides discounted tuition to BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Color), LGBTQ+ individuals &amp; womxn. We recognize that these groups are vastly underrepresented within the industry and pledge to play our part in rectifying that.

codingbootcamp,ReactJS/Front-End Self Taught and Debating a bootcamp? Advice? Springboard BC?,1595117746," 

Hello all! So I am looking for some advice or just any thoughts/feedback would be appreciated on the following:

I'm 23, and I have been trying to become a software engineer for a few months now (since Feb/March). My main focus is in front end - specializing in ReactJS (eventually I would want to become a full stack).  
I have been trying to teach myself and learn and practice after my full time job and then usually use my free weekends to work on this as well. I have created some small apps and projects so far. I have a friend/mentor but I feel like it's lacking in a way, they kinda throw things at me but lack direction/guidance and what have you.

I've been using tools like Udemy courses/camps, YouTube, books, etc to help me learn and develop my skills. However, lately I just feel sort of stuck and frustrated with my growth or maybe lack of. I am 100 percent aware that this takes time and is challenging, that doesn't bother me. My concern or question is, has anyone who is self-taught experienced this and have any advice? What else can I be doing? Are there other resources to find mentors? I also still toggle with the idea of boot-camps and the promising job aspects (?), but again they are quite pricey and may not even be worth it. I've looked at internships but they all require you to be pursing a degree or in school etc so I wouldn't qualify for those. I was looking at Springboard bootcamp by Colt Steele as being one of the top options because of the way they have the payments and its better than an ISA I thinK? 

Thanks so much!"

I picked this one in particular because I still need to work my shitty day job to survive and this looked to have the most flexibility while still supporting you with projects, networking, mentorship, career coaching, etc.

Is it likely I'll face bias?,1594682828,"I'm a mid-30's woman/mother and hoping to change careers from an Educator (I have an MS in Sustainability Eudcation) to being a Software Engineer or Web Developer. I've been a farmer and educator for a long time and while I still really enjoy it, I am burnt out of working nights and weekends for very little appreciation and practically no pay. I'm ready for a better career that will be fulfilling and help me to not stress so much about money.

As a farmer and environmental educator, I'm not coming from a very technical background. That said, I've always been organized, scientifically-minded, and a problem solver. And I've got a I've just started messing around with programming ([Lynda.com](https://lynda.com/) and Automate the Boring Stuff w/ Python) and so far I am really enjoying it. After I learn a little more I'm going to start seeing if I can work on some of my own projects. Its going to be a lot of work to learn enough to apply for jobs, but I'm a pretty determined and organized person and I'm very motivated to do this.

I'd love some thoughts about what entering the workforce as a programmer/SWE/developer would be like as a mid-30's woman who has family obligations. I guess I have a couple of questions:

* Will it be difficult to break into tech as someone coming from an education/teaching background?
* How different is it as a woman in her mid 30's in this field? Is it much harder to get jobs?
* How accepting is this field of the flexibility that can sometimes come with having children?
* What are some tips for someone in my situation to make sure that I succeed?
* Should I consider going back to school or a bootcamp?

Any advice, thoughts, or personal stories are welcomed. I have been thinking about this for years and am really excited to finally be making the move!

codingbootcamp,Coding Dojo | Mid Point Review | update to my earlier post,1593999585,"I posted a few weeks ago about my initial thoughts after enrolling in Coding Dojo Bootcamp. I've been in the program for 8 weeks now and wanted to post an update with my current thoughts for anyone interested..

\----------------------------------------------

At this point I’ve spent over 120 hours within the code bootcamp. I’m at week 8 of 15.

If you haven’t already read my initial thoughts as to why I chose Coding Dojo over other bootcamps, you can check that out here: [https://domvacchiano.com/2020/cd-pre-camp/](https://domvacchiano.com/2020/cd-pre-camp/)

I’ve a couple people reach out to me via my twitter DM’s to ask about the bootcamp after reading my initial post, so I will include answers to their questions. I’m sure you may have similar questions if you are thinking about a bootcamp.

**The first questions were regarding the content.**

Since it’s an online course, everything is handled via the Coding Dojo learning portal:

https://preview.redd.it/n20ltuzd55951.png?width=1811&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cefb77933b4a131673293b341410d72f6cc880d6

The portal is where all the learning is done:

* The learning modules which are video/text combos
* The assignments which build off the learning modules
* The live lecture recordings

The live lectures happen twice weekly and are held via zoom for 1 hour each. In them the instructor goes over the current topic usually by completing one of the assignments. They are useful because the instructor explains things and you can ask questions.

There is also a live chat similar to slack or discord. Within there you can interact with fellow students and instructors. You can also schedule 1-on-1 meetings with instructors to go over any problems.

Many people (possibly even you) may be looking at a bootcamp as a way to make a career change. I took this bootcamp after going down a CS college degree, but working in a different industry after graduating. So all the concepts are not brand new, I’m using it as more a spring board.

However if you are looking at bootcamps as a career change Coding Dojo does have a career services rep that helps you along the way. I haven’t personally used them so I can’t speak from experience.

The career rep contacted us early on regarding setting up our LinkedIn profiles, pushing code to GitHub, and starting to prepare a resume. They stressed that the biggest thing companies are looking for is a portfolio of projects.

The last 4 weeks of the course are dedicated to solo and group projects.

**My personal thoughts so far**

After 8 weeks of spending 20-25 hours coding specifically related to Coding Dojo material (and probably more on self-learning as well) I can say that this is A LOT of material.

Each week or two we cruise through a new major topic or tech. HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Django. Thankfully I was familiar with most of them (barre Django). You could easily spend 4x the amount of time on each concept and still have room to learn more.

However, the chronological order paired with the instructors teaching style helps the concepts make sense. They understand what you know/don’t know since they taught you. So they don’t assume you understand certain tech. And most of the content is pre-recorded so it’s consistent.

**Just like most things, repetitions are a huge factor in committing to memory.**

And so it comes down to putting your fingers on the keyboard, and coding. The nice thing is they give you the opportunity to code a bunch.

Each topic sort of goes like this:

* Learn something \[topic A\]
* Practice \[topic A\]
* Learn something \[topic B\]
* Practice \[topic A and topic B\]
* So on..

You can see from above you get a lot of practice with the various topics. I really like this approach to teaching.

So far I am happy with the Coding Dojo experience and recommend it. I will be back in 4 weeks after completing the final projects, with my final thoughts.

Until then you can follow along on my day-to-day coding and what’s it’s like inside via my Twitter: [https://twitter.com/DomVacchiano](https://twitter.com/DomVacchiano)"

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34TO8o74sk4&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34TO8o74sk4&amp;feature=emb_title)

**Summary:**

\-Learning at Lambda you learn the basics of code, working at a job is what really expands your skills

\- Coming out of bootcamp won’t guarantee a job, being hired requires you to take your own steps to find the jobs

\- The hardest part of Lambda is getting through the journey and not giving up

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn-frwt1hhM&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn-frwt1hhM&amp;feature=emb_title)

**Summary:**

\- Lambda school is very supportive in terms of mental health and making accommodations for emergencies

\-Payment program, pay 17% of income for the first 2 years after you get your job, has cap of around 30,000

\-You get to tutor once you get to a certain part of the curriculum

\-Get to participate in projects that have real world applications, lectures and tips from current software engineers

\-Constantly improving and adding onto curriculum

\-Curriculum will require you to do your own learning and use your skills to help yourself

\-Tutoring system can be frustrating and there can be a lack of help

\-The tutoring system has few qualifications, but they have a large amount of tutors/learning resources to make up for it

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3igNThTdqM&amp;feature=emb\_title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3igNThTdqM&amp;feature=emb_title)

**Summary:**

\-Lambda school is free until you graduate and get a job paying 50k+

\-They teach much more and focus on more modern content than most traditional colleges do

\-Most of the work focuses on having real world applications

\-Very little hand holding, requires you to think and use problem solving skills and to look things up

\-Frequent projects that are actual jobs; ie, developing a website for a company

\-Gives you freedom to apply what you’ve learned and solve problems the way you want to, can be overwhelming and is very time consuming

\-8 students to 1 teach/project manager, easy to communicate with instructors

\-No homework, most of your entire day is filled with the work you’re doing

\-Lambda graduates have an 80%+ job rate

\-Close to the end of the course more focus is put on job finding

[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ix6na/my\_terrible\_experience\_at\_lambda\_school/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/9ix6na/my_terrible_experience_at_lambda_school/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

**Summary:**

\-Overall, not worth it, a scam with a business plan

\-The staff are knowledgeable

\-A lot of the instructors are unprofessional and rude

\-The curriculum frequently changed

\-Very disorganized, trouble with graduation dates, correct classes

\-Instructors have trouble keeping lesson plans coherent and staying on topic, not very open to help

\-Was put into a very dysfunctional group, excluded from discussions and not given access to things other members were

\-Administration took a long time to respond to complaints

\-Was kicked out of the school without any warning and no communication as to why

[https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/boefg4/avoid\_lambda\_schools\_ios\_program/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/boefg4/avoid_lambda_schools_ios_program/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

**Summary:**

\-Some of the teaching assistants are competent enough and some are not; mixed bag between professionals and students

\-No after hours with instructors

\-The more prior experience you have, the more successful you will be with the program

\-Students are allowed to retake parts of courses if they do not pass it in the week, but were often just sent to the next week

\-Students with no prior experience or new to programming will likely struggle with Lambda and keeping up with the curriculum

\-There is a lot of self learning required between lectures and assignments, and a small time frame for assignments to be completed

\-There are no dedicated staff members to answer questions

I am on the third week of the first unit (first month), next week it will be a build week where I could choose a data set and explore it using the material that I learned in the previous week. I am writing this to share my experience and would love to hear your perspective as well.  


Let's start with the admission process  


It was quite easy. I just need to finish a challenge and finish a pre-course program. The pre-course is not mandatory because I passed the challenge but I did it anyway to prepare myself.  


the positives:  


The program forces you to learn quickly and get into a learning rhythm.  


It is also nice that they have the ISA option so you don't have to upfront the cost.  


Most of the students are nice.  


Now let's go to the negatives:  


Lambda school should design the pre-course to be more comprehensive. The first week they introduced you to both phyton and data science, I have zero codings experience, don't know phyton, and my data science experience is close to zero. I felt so overwhelmed. I kinda suffered from Imposter syndrome because of it.  


They pride themselves on their support system however I feel like I received little to none support during the program. Especially during the after-hours or before hours. They have 20 minutes rule, work on a problem for 20 minutes, and if you still stuck ask the TLs. The TLs sometimes only gives you a hint, or just give you the answer (ie the code) but failed to explain the answer conceptually. Some of them actually pretty good but a lot of them are not so good.  


The instructor only holds 4 hours of office hours in a week, the rest just lecture time (3 hours a day). There is no one on one office hours. For their price tag $30,000 for 9 months I expect to be able to have one on one office hours with the instructor. In Lambda school, they discourage me from asking directly to the professor outside the class. On our first day, they told us if you encountered a problem, ask google, if you still stuck ask your TL, if they stuck ask your section lead, then if you really stuck your section lead will ask the Instructor. The thing is when your TL stuck, they just gave you the code and vaguely explain from the lecture note. For a $30,000 program, I expected more support.  


When the TL holds office hours, sometimes they just chatted with one another, which is fine. However, I heard them refers to COVID 19 as a Chinese invasion, as a minority, I could not help but felt disgusted by the comment. I know they are joking but I do not think it is appropriate for a professional setting.  


As I said, I never coded before, I did not realize how easy it is to find the material online. All of their material is online, you just need to create a study plan and you could learn on your own. Lambda School is not prestigious nor that I think that a company really cares about prestige when hiring a programmer (I think they just care that you can actually do the job).   


The test and material are full of flaws, typos, missing codes. On our first sprint challenge, they provided a wrong suggested answer, making a few students questioned themselves. They expect you to always be on slack, the slack channels are nightmares to navigate.  


I just think $30K is too much for a school that builds on zoom and slack. I'll be better off with just exploring the internet, watch youtube videos, and create projects on my own."

codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp vs Computer Science Degree in 2020--- A Review by a Coding Bootcamp and College Grad,1591629244,"Hey all, I see this question a lot. I've been through a coding bootcamp after graduating from college (non CS degree) and I am now working as a developer, so I wanted to try to help answer.

A video I made discussing
[https://youtu.be/VCfEbgntzP0](https://youtu.be/VCfEbgntzP0)

&amp;#x200B;

I copied my [original post from my site](https://www.santamariacode.com/home/coding-bootcamp-or-computer-science-degree) and pasted the content below.

If  you can afford either, think about your career goals. CS degrees take you farther up the corporate ladder and they are requirements for some companies. So for career advancement- making VP Engineering likely requires a CS degree. Another thing to think about. CS degrees require years of study, which leads to a deeper understanding and a lot more hours writing code. However, college is not cheap, nor does everyone have the ability to attend one. 

Coding bootcamps, while much cheaper and faster, will help you learn how to code. However, the knowledge gained from a bootcamp will be far less than the knowledge of a computer science graduate. Bootcamps tend to focus on real world applications and modern technology. In order words, bootcamps are designed to help get you a job- computer science degrees are designed to help you learn computer science.

## Coding Bootcamp Pros

* Faster
* Cheaper
* Make real life applications
* Learn interview algorithm
* Learn interviewing techniques and get job search support
* Learn the tech that’s getting used right now
* Better return on investment- make more per hour with how much effort you put in"

Next steps for learning.,1591182717,"I'm keen to learn more and have more options with my career - I'm 34 and have been in IT sales &amp; customer service for 10+ years but I am now looking to enhance my technical understanding and abilities to perhaps look at a higher paying role / freelance for a supplementary income and eventually  to start out on my own.

My understanding of bootcamps are that they require a huge amount of time/effort which might not work around current employment/family life and are normally very expensive. 

Can anyone expand at a high level what's out there that maybe entails the following:

* Flexible / Remote Learning - no time limits
* Not overly expensive / Free
* Material is up to date and relevant for jobs today and in the future. 
* No need for an official education in Computer Science or likewise.

Any advice is welcome, I know it's probably been asked a million times before but keen to get some views on it from anyone with similar experience who has perhaps gone down this route."

codingbootcamp,An honest review of Trilogy bootcamp from a recent grad,1588348519,"Hey all. If you're familiar with coding bootcamps, I'm sure you've ran across horror stories of Trilogy bootcamp. For those who don't know, Trilogy is a company that runs many coding bootcamps across the country at large, well known universities and disguises under the university's name while maintaining full control of their instructors, TA's, and curriculum. My post won't dive into the ethics of that as it's another discussion on it's own. 

&amp;#x200B;

The pros: 

The TA's were some of the best I've ever had, including my TA's throughout undergrad. They were an joy to work with. The instructor also had his good moments. He was clearly a very knowledgeable engineer but had his faults. That's about it for the pros. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cons: 

The curriculum fails to tie important concepts together - each concept is taught in a vacuum. The curriculum is full stack web development so it went: HTML &gt; CSS &gt; JavaScript &gt; JQuery &gt; Project &gt; Node JS and Express &gt; MySQL &gt; Project &gt; MongoDB &gt; React &gt; Project. As you can see, it does a sort of rollercoaster from front end, to back end, to front end. All throughout this rollercoaster, they fail to tie the front and back ends together i.e. assignments done while learning backend had the entire front end done for us. So when it actually comes time to put the two together, all the students need a long refresher on how the other works. 

The class prefaces a lot of concepts, such as CS concepts like Big O and Algorithms by saying ""we just want to introduce you to these concepts so you recognize them when asked about it in an interview."" This is just incredibly misleading. From my experience taking other online courses and talking to industry pros, CS concepts like Algos and Big O are INCREDIBLY important when trying to land a job. It's how you get through the hiring process. Telling students that they're not such a big deal and that simply knowing the terms for an interview is so so so misleading. 

This leads me to my biggest gripe with the course. Many of the students are full time workers, as i was part of a part-time class. Only AFTER you've started paying and attending class do they tell you that you need AT LEAST 20+ hours a week of extra learning. That was fine and easy for me because I wasn't working throughout the course. But for the people who actually had to work? By the end of the class, they were all far behind on homework assignments, cramming, and turning in half assignments. And let me just be clear, the assignments were not particularly hard and lengthy. They were easily done in a day, maybe 2 at the most if you understood the concepts. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reality: 

6 months for a part time course or 3 months for a full time course are simply just not enough time.

The class fails to set the right expectations for people. It's marketed as ""job ready after completion"" but that's far from the truth. A more realistic assertion would be ""job ready after completion if you spend at lesat 25 hours a week learning ADDITIONAL concepts"" and not just doing the course's activities. Early on, i had watched many videos on being a junior developer/engineer that set a very high bar for me, so i was able to put in more time outside of class knowing these expectations. Unfortunately for many in my class, I dont think that was the case.

codingbootcamp,How coding bootcamps brought ISAs to the mass market,1587576925,"Over the past few months, I've become completely fascinated by Income Share Agreements and how much of an impact they're having on higher education.

For those that might not know, ISA's are a way for students to finance education without paying upfront. Instead, students pay back the institution by sharing a percentage of their income for a fixed number of years.

ISA's are a hotly debated topic, but one of the biggest benefits is that they align the incentives of educators and students. 

Programs have to actually deliver results in order to get paid. 

The idea of Income Share Agreements have been around since 1955, but they haven't seen mass adoption until recently.

This post covers the recent history of ISA's and how they helped kickstart the coding bootcamp revolution. 

Kush Patel, Founder &amp; CEO of App Academy, and I recently had an in-depth [recorded conversation](https://blog.tryvirtually.com/how-isas-entered-the-mass-market-w-kush-patel-ceo-of-app-academy/) exploring this topic. 

From what we could tell... the spark for the coding bootcamp revolution came from a single hacker news post. This one to be [specific](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3267133). 

This is the first semblance of an ISA being used with respect to software engineering education that I could find.

Back in 2011, Kush and his brother saw this post and decided to enroll. This is how Kush describes his experience:

""you'd be putting in close to a hundred hours a week I mean, I literally dreamed in code.  It was wild. I never thought anything like that could happen""

After the program, Kush saw how quickly other students were able to land jobs and start their software engineering careers. What impressed him the most was how impactful the program was on their lives. 

Students of the program went from being baristas and service workers making minimum wage to suddenly making six-figure salaries as Software Engineers at the biggest tech companies in the world. 

Seeing this firsthand is what he says gave him the idea for App Academy. 

He and his co-founder launched the company in June of 2012. Not long after that, they become the first coding bootcamp to incorporate an Income Share Agreements as a financing option. 

Others would fast-follow. 

Make School in 2014. Lambda School in 2017. Flockjay in 2018. And now, in 2020, [hundreds of programs](https://tryvirtually.com/career-accelerators) are using this ""deferred tuition"" model.

ISA's have had a few false starts, but for the first time, it looks as if they're off the races.

I believe largely this is because never before had the market been aligned for this type of financing to succeed. 

Software engineering education became the first killer use case for ISA's. And now, it's quickly seeing mass adoption. 

It's so important that we start to see this idea spread *now* more than *ever*. 

According to the Washington Post, over 10M Americans filed for the unemployment benefits in the month of March alone. We're seeing some of the highest unemployment numbers since the great depression. 

These individuals need job training and they need it now. Traditional higher education isn't going to cut it. 

We need a new method of job training. 

One that is accessible from anywhere, provides trade-specific knowledge (no fluff and can be completed in &lt;1 year), and is generally risk-free (leverages an ISA or a deferred-tuition model). 

If there was ever a time for ISA's and career accelerators to thrive, it's now. 

And it's all thanks to an innocent Hacker News post from 2011."

codingbootcamp,Codeworks vs Le Wagon vs ... ?,1586688000,"Hello,

I am planning to go to the bootcamp, if possibble already this year... Now I have a trouble choosing the right one. Since it is not small amount of money, I don't want to choose ""the wrong one"" . As far as I've googled, Le Wagon is always ranked #1 in Europe. Althrough I am a little bit worried, since they are learning mostly Ruby on Rails, and to me it seems that ruby is not in such a demand (correct me if I am wrong). On the other hand I have found Codeworks bootcamp, which has pretty good curriculum on the first view. They have lots of JS and both React and Angular and for the back-end Node and Express. I find also good that you need to have already basic knowledge of js to get into bootcamp at all, because I am not a full beginner myself. I already know HTML/CSS, intermediate JS, basics of Node and Bootstrap framework. So you need to pass interview, and technical interview as well, and they stated on their website, that they accept only 5% of applicants (we don't know are they saying the truth tho...).  Problem at Codeworks  is that they don't have enough feedbacks (I have seen only positive feedbacks, but there is far less total feedback than at Le Wagon). So any suggestions which one do you find to be better? Or maybe some third one that is available in Berlin, Germany?  ( for example I saw IronHack pretty high ranked as well...).

TLDR: Which bootcamp in Berlin would you suggest? Codeworks or Le wagon or some third one?"

codingbootcamp,if your in south florida and looking to attend a Coding Bootcamp. Well to filter out... DONT ATTEND WYNCODE ACADEMY!,1586550004," I had an interview with the Wyncode manager ( Francis  Martinez) about financing for Wyncode and she says we have ISA but kept pushing me to finance with climb credit.   By the Way,  the interview wasn't even an interview. There was no technical challenge (which all coding boot camps I applied to asked for me to do a technical challenge)  so that was very questionable for me.  After I got accepted to the program (First week of March), every week leading to the curriculum shes asking me about applying to climb credit when I told her ill do the ISA. On April 10th  I put in a lot of applications for climb credit and on the deadline before the curriculum she then tells me there is no ISA option after I didn't get accepted for the credit option.  When I kept saying ill DO THE ISA OPTION. I wasted a lot of time. Also, their curriculum is 9 weeks accelerated which is pretty fast for a new person just getting started with javascript. The pre-work to get started with the Bootcamp isn't the best way to grasp the material before class either. They don't cover data structures and algorithm technical interview questions either. It was literally all over the place. I usually don't do reviews for companies but this Bootcamp was a mess. Please Don't ATTEND THIS SCHOOL.

I consider myself lucky to have found a subreddit like this. I’m on path to graduate undergrad as a mechanical engineer at the end of this semester, but recent job experience and changing interests have motivated me to take a different path. 

I would like to aim to start off with a position in software engineering once this quarantine is over, rather than wasting time applying for mechanical engineer positions I have no interest in. I don’t consider myself mechanically inclined and I never intended to do mechanical engineering for the long term anyways. I’ve always been good at math, problem solving, and finding patterns, the long term appeal of automation/coding intrigues me and I believe I have the tools to be successful in this field. 

If anyone has a similar career path or know this feeling of being a rookie, any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. I am currently taking advantage of Codecademy’s Pro 90 day free trial for students and completing a web development course.

So i'm one of the millions of human shrapnel from the recent layoff explosions.   I've been working in tech for more than a decade (electronics), and doing basic hacky scripting since 2016 when it was needed.  Recently, I was hired, then laid off at a short lived startup in mid Feb. It was my first role doing nothing but punching away at Python, InfluxDB, using Numpy and Pandas, etc.  And I loved it!!! I'm no expert, but I can figure things out, even if it took me all night.

Long story short, I don't wanna go back to being building electronics just yet.  I loved the freedom that coding gave me.  I could wake up early for work, go surfing in the afternoon, and then come home and work all night.  This is not typically possible with most hardware jobs where you need to be onsite somewhere from 9-5 typically. So i'm going to use this quarantine vacation to ramp up my skills enough to get hired in back into software.  

&amp;#x200B;

REQUEST FOR ADVICE:

I notice alot of data science jobs require a Masters or PhD.  I only have a BS in electrical engineering.  If I take the Data Science immersive, do I still have a good chance of getting into data?  Or should I just focus on the Software Engineering immersive program?  It seems that software engineer positions often don't have such degree requirements attached to them.

My goal is to be the most hire-able coder I can be, with plenty of options and freedom for flex hours, remote work, etc.  I think data science is cool, and I really enjoyed the results of getting data from InfluxDB and manipulating it with python into cool graphs.  But I don't want to end up competing with a ton of PhD's.

By 2008, I was working as a UX designer for a consulting firm. Unfortunately, because of the time period and progression of my career, I fell WAY behind in hard skills, and lost my job in the 2008 downturn. Since 2008, I've been doing support engineering consisting of mostly process engineering under an ITIL/ITSM framework and technical writing.

I'm also not interested in teaching myself. I'd be motivated to get up and go to class 3 nights a week and do the required homework, but have a hard time motivating myself all on my own. I need a classroom setting to keep me motivated and keep me on a planned path. 

  
I'm really all about looking for the right place that can just teach me to code. Landing a job is secondary to me, I have a job. 

  
Anyone know if there is a school that meets my criteria better than UW Coding Bootcamp (by Trilogy)? It should be in the Seattle area."
codingbootcamp,Turing or WGU computer science degree?,1582842129,"Hi All!

I am stuck in life and need some advice! I currently work as a surgical technologist after obtaining an associates degree. I hate the job. I am really interested in coding/it jobs. I have zero experience in this field so I was thinking about going back to school. Would I have more of a chance of gaining employment after going to a coding boot camp (Turing) or getting a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from WGU? I know sometimes a bachelor's degree looks better on a resume but not sure if I will learn everything I need.

My friend and I are both senior web developers and we came up with a tool to help all developers to grow in their career (from job seeker to senior developer).

We all agree that there are plenty of available online resources for all type of developers but we think that it is not an easy job to know exactly what to search in order to become a better developer. Since I’m a technical career coach in a bootcamp and he’s a technical lead, we wanted to share our knowledge and experience throughout small and easy to read articles that are grouped by topics.

We’ve just started the development and it is currently in beta but I’m posting it here because the only content we’ve built is related to job seeking and we wanted to ask for your feedback. We are planning on adding a lot of features and new content (cheat sheet, weekly email articles to read, collaboration with different authors, checklist of things to accomplish, a topic about surviving your first week as a developer, etc...) if the feedback is positive. We built this tool with passion and with the idea to help people, we hope you will find it useful!

Here’s the link: [https://pathify.dev](http://pathify.dev/)

codingbootcamp,7 Bad habits and practices new developers have,1581162898,"What is a bad habit?

A bad habit is a habitual behaviour that is considered detrimental to a developers career (in the development context obviously, other bad habits outside development are smoking and clapping when the plane successfully lands).

Bad habits intrerupt your workflow and can prevent your from making effective progress and sometimes they can lead to losing your job.

The worst thing about bad habits is that they require more energy to break away from compared to when trying to create new habits.

What causes a bad habit?

A bad habit is usually caused by simply not knowing any better and by lack of experience and or guidance.

How to fix a bad habit?

You can’t fix a bad habit, you can just replace it with a new habit.

Without any specific order, I see this bad habits over and over again with new developers:

1. Leaving commented out code

This seems like a very innocent one, especially if you work by yourself.

Don’t leave commented out code (at least not on the master branch), you will encounter it in a few weeks or months and you won’t remember what was its use, it’s a big gateway for confusion.

Simply make sure you don’t save any work with unnecessary code.

2. Not using git

This is pretty much explanatory, if you need more information about why you should use git, let me know and I will make another post about that.

3. Not using git the right way and pushing to master all the time

Well, are you using git like it’s DropBox or are you taking advantage of the branching and versioning system?

If you are just pushing to master, I suggest looking into best practices of using git, understanding why git is one of the essential tools a developer has in his arsenal.

4. Doing multiple things at once (really close to my heart because I almost lost my job)

Common sense is not so common, this might not seem as bad or obvious, but when you work on 3 features of your app at the same time, and you decide to drop one of them (because requirements changed or \[insert any other reason\]) or you made a few mistakes (and you have random dependencies), how do you know you are not going to affect the other features that have not yet finalised?

When I started my career, because I did not have any formal training, this point wasn’t that obvious to me. I remember I was working on 2 features on the same branch and I totally messed up one of them so I had to throw away MORE THAN ONE MONTH worth of work and I was really close to losing my job.

5. Not going back to refactor old code

You always learn, you always improve, you can always do things better. Whenever you get the chance, go back and update your old work with the new things you have learned.

6. Poor variable and function names (check the photo)

// Avoid Single Letter Names

var a = “apple’' // use fruit

// Avoid Acronyms

let npm = “No Password Management”'

// Avoid Abbreviations

let cat = 'cat or category??';

// Avoid Describing the Data Structure

var obj = {};

// Avoid Meaningless Names

var data = \[“what is data?”\];

// What the H3££??

var a = new Lion();

7. Not planning your work and not taking notes

I always suggest using a tool like Trello or Notion to track your project’s tasks, similarly to what you would do in a work environment.

Notion is a great tool where you can track different moving parts of your project and it can help you organise yourself so much better. Using notion and git will make you a 10x dev in my humble opinion.

Other bad habits that I did not include are lack of communication, not documenting your code and not leaving instructions for yourself or other developers.

What are some of the bad habits or practices that you are doing constantly? Are there other things that I’m missing?

codingbootcamp,3 Biggest Mistakes I Made When I Was Learning to Code,1581007841,"When I started learning to code, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. As I was reading blogs, watching videos on this topic, I noticed two main things. The first one was: ‘Everyone can learn to code because coding is easy’ and ‘People getting stuck because things did not make sense to them’.

Well, now, as I’ve been coding for a few years professionally and mentoring people how to code for a living, I realized the 3 biggest mistakes I made while learning to code.

**1. Shiny object syndrome (S.O.S.)**

Shiny object syndrome is when you jump from tutorial to tutorial, from course to course, roadmap to roadmap, thinking that finally, you will get the best solution for your problems, this is the only thing you have to do to learn to code and get a job. 

As you go through the course, you will reach a stage where things will get difficult and you will think this course it’s dumb, or you are too dumb and instead of pushing through the discomfort you decide to buy another course or find a better alternative. And you go again through the basics, waste one more month, just to find out that when it gets hard you want to quit again in favor of the next shiny new thing that is on discount on a course platform. 

This comes from the idea that what you are doing right now it’s not good enough or you feel like it’s too hard and there should be an alternative that’s easier. Because learning to code it’s easy, which is not. If it would be easy you would not get paid over $100,000 per year. 

Instead, if you have the shiny object syndrome, you should just stick to your course or your roadmap for at least 60 days. The best way of sticking to something its accountability, found someone to hold you accountable and you will be golden.

The grass is not greener on the other side, the grass is greener wherever you water it. 

**2. Not doing**

Not doing means exactly what you think, it means you spend hours watching tutorials, maybe not even typing along, thinking that somehow you will learn how to code. Instead, you know a lot of things that make no sense to you. The moment you close the tutorial, you forget everything you learned, you hate the boring syntax because you don’t understand what it does. 

Congratulations, you got 100 points in the javascript quiz, but you can’t even put some text on the page without checking 10 tutorials. 

Instead what I would do, is try to make a small project, and break everything down into small steps and google word by word all the steps and try to put them together. It might take you 2 weeks to learn to toggle and HTML class, but you will be thankful for those 2 weeks in one year from now. Learning is based on the compound effect. In the beginning, you might not see any progress, but at some point, things will click for you and your knowledge will explode. You will write code with your eyes closed ;).

**3. Not having a roadmap and a war map**

War map? A war map means planning 3-6 months ahead, knowing what you will be doing every week, every day. 

Do some market research, find out what the jobs in the niche you want to work from your area require. Put all the skills on a piece of paper, and google all of those skills, you will start noticing some of those skills coming up and up again. Don’t be lazy with this. Don’t waste your time. That’s your gold, learn those things.

I help aspiring frontend developers in their 30's and 40's to get their first React job, and so I’ve been asked many times how to start learning to code.

First time posting on reddit.

I've been reading through some reviews online about coding bootcamps and most I've seen are somewhat negative. People say that they cover the very very basics of programming and I don't want to pay a lot of money and spend a lot of time to learn only the basics. 

So my question is:

How basic are coding bootcamps? (General Assembly, if anyone has gone through their course)

codingbootcamp,Graduated coding bootcamp only to realize I enjoy UX design much more - What should I do?,1572753717,"I recently graduated from a full-stack  bootcamp and after getting a one-day crash course on UX/UI design, I realized I enjoyed UX/UI design much more than coding and now feel like I wasted my time and money on a coding bootcamp when I should've attended a UX/UI bootcamp instead. (Thankfully the coding bootcamp I chose wasn't one of the more expensive ones so I wasn't left with post-graduation debt.)

I'm wondering if it would be worth it for me to attend a UX/UI design bootcamp that offers deferred payment (promise of a job) or if I should try and teach myself UX instead? 

Has anyone attended more than one bootcamp? And was it something worth doing?

Has anyone ever attended a coding bootcamp and ended up being a UX/UI designer instead of a full-stack/front-end web developer?"

codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp geared more towards Entrepreneurship/Project building than employability?,1571870775,"Hey everyone -

I'm a mid 20's professional on the marketing side of tech, and i've always had the ambition to code little side projects, and maybe eventually do something full time. In the past i've tried taking online classes, etc, but I haven't been able to commit the time/energy, and just end up quitting.

Recently i've been thinking more about this - and I've realized that i'll have to devote all of my time to this to start seeing rewards. So, I immediately started looking around at some coding bootcamps (fortunate enough to be able to afford this both financially and in terms of time.)

After speaking to some bootcamp alumni and doing some research, many believe that their bootcamp *did not* prepare them to do their own projects, etc. I've heard that many are still uncomfortable hosting/deploying things, playing around with file structure, etc.

So - what i'm trying to figure out is, if i'm not trying to work as a SWE afterwards, but rather trying to build out my own projects, *are there certain bootcamps or other avenues I should be lookin at?*

Thanks!"

codingbootcamp,Trilogy Education Services: Avoid at All Costs,1567168929," Hi there,

I am a recent graduate of a cybersecurity bootcamp organized by Trilogy Education Services at Columbia University. Some of you may be aware of this company which administers a variety of coding, cyber, and data analytic bootcamps often in partnership with universities.

I am writing this thread to warn others who may considering it to save their money and look elsewhere. The cybersecurity bootcamp organized by Trilogy is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in education. Myself and my fellow classmates paid $12,000 to attend this course on the assumption that the curriculum, teachers, and overall course had been designed in coordination with Columbia. This could not be further from the truth.

Over the course of the next six months, we experienced an extremely disjointed and unprofessional program including a complete lack of support from career services, a verbally abusive instructor whom Trilogy, after many complaints, did nothing about, non-functional labs, poor AV equipment that made recordings largely inaudible for anyone who was absent or wanted to attend remotely, and finally, a complete disregard for the well being of the students.

In the six months we were there, we probably sent 6 to 7 weeks in totally actually focusing on useful and practical content. I cannot express to you how frustrating it was to sit through the majority of this course knowing the projects, presentations, and material being presented was in many cases factually wrong or irrelevant to our future careers.

The saddest part about this experience was how it affected the lives of many of the students in the course. Between the horrible curriculum and a verbally abusive teacher, many students quickly became dismayed and received no support from Trilogy throughout the entire process. People spend their hard earned savings or took out loans to participate in this course on the promise of a chance to achieve something that was impossible from the start.

Without going on a rant, there are plenty more details I can share, but my number one recommendation is avoid attending any of Trilogy's bootcamps and to advise anyone considering them to do the same. You can find plenty of other similar reviews out there and trust me, despite a few positive ones, you are not going to be that lucky person who got the perfect teacher and curriculum. With Trilogy, it does not exist."
codingbootcamp,I just biffed my last chance a/A interview and I'm gutted,1567036662,"So, my first interview went okay except for when we got to the technical bit it was a problem I should have solved with hashes but I solved with a bunch of conditionals instead. 

They said I seemed like a good candidate and wanted to give me another chance and today was the last day I could have done it so I had another interview today that went well but then it got to a question that I'm pretty sure I needed to solve with .map but instead iterated and shoveled into a new array based on conditionals. Not only that but when the code didn't work it took me 5 minutes to find that I put an or where an and should have been to fix it. 

Basically had to take every other number out of an array, reverse it, then do it again until there was 1 element left and I defined 2 methods to do it. One was the while to call my meat and potatoes method and reverse the result and the other was the method with my if index is odd then shovel into new array and it was just a frickin mess and I'm really upset and this post has no point I just wanted to let everyone know how disappointed I am in myself."

codingbootcamp,Opinions on a bootcamp that teaches three stacks.,1565589212,"I’ve convinced myself to join a coding bootcamp but what’re your opinions on a bootcamp that teaches THREE stacks (Python based stack, Java based stack, and MEAN stack). This bootcamp is based off of web development and is preparing you to become a Full Stack Web Developer. They claim that by learning these three stacks, it’ll allow for more versatility in skills and that employers will like it. 

Deep down inside, I only want to learn stacks like MEAN/MERN which is based around JavaScript and feel that it MIGHT be as useful to learn those other stacks. I’ve looked at other options but I can’t do the commute whereas this bootcamp that I’m looking into is local and would be very convenient for me to drive to (10 min. Drive)

codingbootcamp,How to Recognize a Good (or Bad) Coding Bootcamp,1559524546,
codingbootcamp,Looking for real info,1558958012,"Hello all!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to find solid data. I want to avoid posting the typical ""Is it worth it"", ""Should I / Shouldn't I?"", ""Which one...?"" posts, that's not my intention and I've read 15 already. My mind is fairly made up, but I have a history of forgetting to do research when I set myself on a path, so I'm here to evaluate my decision with data. From experience, I like to dismiss claims shared by even the most ""transparent"" businesses. Regardless of industry, they are in the business of making money, and I don't like to take their word for it. So I turn to the people.

&amp;#x200B;

My background. I'm a vet using my GI Bill to attend a coding bootcamp. Of my relevant experience, I had 6 months in IT as a PM (no certs at the time) prior to my time in service, and over the past 14 months I've gotten 4 CompTIA certs and 10 months in an Amazon data center. I don't see much upwards growth available, and want to transition to the SDE field for more upwards potential and flexibility in where I can work. For bootcamps covered by the GI Bill, I'd consider locations in Seattle or SLC, but I don't like the options in SLC, so Seattle is my plan. Currently leaning towards Codefellows, full stack course with a second 401 right after.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know has to do with job placement rates, demographics of those who didn't get hired in x months, where those jobs are, so on. All of my questions will specifically have to do with Codefellows and Coding Dojo in Seattle.

First up, I see people comment on posts saying those claims of 95%+ job placement are not true, closer to 60%. Are their claims true, and what are the parameters in regards to what qualifies? For example, if somebody were hired the next day as a janitor at a lumber yard for $90k, would they count that?

Second, I want some insight into who doesn't get hired. I saw somebody claim everybody they knew who attended a bootcamp who wasn't meaningfully employed after one year either a) was in it to get rich quick, b) wasn't serious, or c) didn't have dependents, regardless of other factors or qualifications. Is that realistic? Are the majority of ""failures"" those who just don't care enough?

Third, I've read that a lot of the hires are from nearby networked employers. I don't want to stay in Seattle after I'm done. Should I expect my opportunities outside of Seattle to be significantly reduced? Or are the two options well enough regarded that it isn't much of an issue?

Fourth, more personal situation here, how much would my mentioned prior experience be worth to a prospective employer? Assuming I could already get my foot in the door, and optimistically assuming my example work from the course and outside are at least above mediocre in quality."

Did you feel you learned everything you needed within the 14 weeks?

Were you able to pick the stacks?

Was it worth the cost of tuition?

Did they truly assist in finding you a job?

If you full change anything would you?

Full time in person or Full time online?

I'm an undergrad student a year away from graduating with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. However my school doesn't really teach web development and I still don't feel confident in my coding ability.

I wanted to try out web development and have been studying HTML and CSS in my free time on CodeAcademy. I'm enjoying it so far but with a full-time school schedule I haven't been able to dedicate as much of my time to it as I like. Apart from learning web dev, I want to be able to improve my resume and Github repo with projects during the summer.

I've looked at these two options so far as well if anyone knows anything about them. General Assembly and Columbia Engineering. My friend is doing the last right now and is enjoying it. Very expensive tho

codingbootcamp,Trilogy Bootcamp Review (From Teacher's Perspective),1551316500,"Full disclosure, I've worked for a Trilogy  bootcamp at a university for over a year but am probably going to leave  after this next class ends, cause I'm just not liking the way the  bootcamp is managed. So some of this may sound like a disgrunted  employee but I hope I can shed some light on what's good (and bad) about  this particular brand of bootcamp. I would also love to know what it's like teaching for other bootcamps and how they deal with similar issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Good**

* The  curriculum overall follows a logical progression where everything  builds on itself. You start with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, move  into back-end with Node.js and databases, then come back to the  front-end with React.
* Once you have all of the activities, they are a great reference for building apps in the future.
* The  group projects are a great way to get some fake 'real world experience'  since you and your team have to come up with a large-scale idea and  then build it. This is where you'll learn the most about Git, too.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bad**

* A  lot of the activities are poorly constructed, and students spend the  majority of the allotted activity time just trying to figure out what  they're being asked to do.
* The  pace is a little too fast, cause the bootcamp isn't so much about  making sure you understand the basics as it is introducing you to the  next buzz word that you can put on your resume. For example, we only  spend a few days on regular Javascript before moving on to jQuery. Same  with CSS and Bootstrap or mySQL and Sequelize.
* TA's  are paid shit and therefore probably aren't going to take the class  seriously. Hell, they may not even be qualified to be there. I think the  bar is pretty low for hiring TA's.
* Career  support is a joke. This has consistently been the #1 complaint from  students. The career coach is hard to get a hold of and either offers  very obvious advice or advice that conflicts with what the teacher has  been saying.
* Saturday  classes are a combined class where the Mon/Wed and Tues/Thurs classes  meet together. 60 people in one room is too much. Also, the teacher on  Saturday alternates, so the presentation isn't consistent.

&amp;#x200B;

So should you still attend?

&amp;#x200B;

**Yes, if...**

* You  are very driven and self-disciplined and really want to learn to code  (and specifically learn to code web apps). This can't just be a passing  interest. You have to really want this and work hard at it.
* You  have the necessary free time outside of class to study. If you honestly  can't put in 20 or 30 or 40 hours of self studying, you're not going to  make it.

&amp;#x200B;

**No, if...**

* You  have very basic computer skills. If you don't know how to manage  browser tabs or you don't know the keyboard shortcut to copy and paste,  don't enroll. Not knowing how to use your computer will slow you down  considerably.
* English  isn't your first language. This puts you at a huge disadvantage, cause  the class moves very quickly, and you're not going to have time to  translate everything to keep up.
* You  don't like working in groups. I get it, group work sucks. You always  have that one teammate who doesn't care and doesn't contribute. As I  said, though, you have three big group projects, and in Trilogy's case, a  lot of activities are meant to be done with one or two partners.
* You  are the type of person who needs to understand every detail and needs  to know ""why"" and ""how"" things work. You'll spend the entire class  frustrated, cause the teacher just doesn't have time to slow down and  explain things in greater detail.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately,  I see a lot of students admitted to the bootcamp who probably shouldn't  have been. Not that they aren't smart and can't learn to code but the  pace of the class isn't suited for them or web development wasn't really  what they wanted. Trilogy is a for-profit company so of course they're  going to take everyone they can, but do your research first and really  think about what it is you want and what your limitations are."

I've been here 9 months and I feel like i am improving bit by bit and day by day. However i do feel like I am a bit useless compared to the other devs here, full on impostor syndrome.

I've also realized that you will not improve your programming skills by just going to work, i've had to do a hell of a lot more outside the office just to sharpen my skills, and even then i feel like i am still wayyyyy behind.  I don't really have any mentorship at all here, which isnt down to poor management or anything, the tech lead is fantastic here, he is just way too busy #agencylife.

I am now looking at another 2 years to finish this degree when the cohort starts this Fall, will finish with a BASC in Comp Sci if i go the CS route. 

I have completed Python, SQL, HTML/CSS and Java classes, and now trying to decide where to go. 

My questions is, should i continue this CS route? Or would a boot-camp be as sufficient at getting me a job in web development, business intelligence, data analytics or UX/UI?

I mostly just want to get to working. 2 years on the CS track doesn't seem as appealing as 6 Months (maybe less since i have completed some CS classes?) via a Boot-Camp. I have many friends who support boot camps and then a few who support the CS route.

Background: He is 32 and makes around $100k a year in a job with the federal government, with good benefits.  He has a B.A. in economics and his background is primarily in health care (market analysis/ insurance/ hospital operations).  He likes the health care industry but HATES his current (very bureaucratic) job and wants to get out of government and into a career where he can actually make a difference and get things done. He's willing to move for a new job- right now we live in a small rural town and he works remotely most of the time and commutes to DC once a week. He's held leadership/executive positions in the past and doesn't want to start over from the bottom, although he'd be willing to take a (reasonable) short-term pay cut to move into a position with better future prospects than his current one.

He's considering taking unpaid leave to do one of the more reputable 12 week coding boot camps (General Assembly or similar), maybe in Boston or Austin.  It would be around $12k, plus the time off from work and living expenses.  He doesn't have any specific jobs in mind that require the specific set of skills they teach at the boot camps, but is hoping that having those skills on his resume will open up job opportunities and that maybe he'll make connections with people through the program in a new industry and see opportunities he's not aware of currently.  It seems like the world is moving online and he wants to have the skills needed to take advantage of future opportunities.  He's done some (but not a ton of) programming in past jobs and enjoyed it.

(1) Have any of y'all anyone gone to coding bootcamp or otherwise learned to code to boost mid-career advancement (rather than right out of college, or to completely switch careers and start over ""from the bottom"" as a software engineer)? If so, what was your experience?

(2) Would this be worth the money?  By my math we're looking at maybe $40k for this once you factor in opportunity costs... in general, is knowing the stuff they teach at these bootcamps worth that much in the long run, whether in salary or in other benefits?

(3) If boot camp is a bad idea, do you have any better suggestions?"
codingbootcamp,My SO just started boot camp. Is there anything I can do to help them be successful?,1531280714,"Of course I have already discussed this with them, but their only answer seems to be ""just understand that I may not be around much."" I know they'll be busy, and I'll be making sure they have food and clean clothes. 

Was there anything that would have made the course easier, or that you wish you had? I'm probably overthinking this, but I want to try to cover all the bases.

Thanks for any input!"
codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp Comparison in Denver,1530556921,"Hello all,

I moved to Denver about 3 months ago and have been actively looking for a job in IT. My background is managing a Helpdesk for 2.5 years at a university and having a degree in IT with a couple certifications. 

I have decided to transition to more of the dev side of things now and am wanting to go to a coding bootcamp in  the Denver area.  

The ones I’ve seen are:  DU Coding Bootcamp, Galvanize, General Assembly, Skill Distillery, Tech Academy, and Turing. 

Does anyone have any experience with any of these?

This is cross posted. Thanks!"
codingbootcamp,Coding Bootcamp Question,1530552409,To anyone who could assist I was hoping to get some guidance on attending UPenn's Coding bootcamp. I have a B.S. in Finance/Economics and have been working for 4 years at one of the major banks but am looking to get a skill that is highly marketable and UPenn has a stellar reputation in the city of Philadelphia and nationally. Is it worth my time? I have enjoyed coding the little I've done and am curious to see what others think.

codingbootcamp,Thoughts on Launch School's software engineering program?,1528909996,"I'm considering signing up for Launch School and would love some thoughts on the program. I'm American but currently living in Canada, so the capstone program wouldn't be available to me. Is the program still worth it without that program afterward?
Some other top contenders are FlatIron and FireHose Project. For some background info, I definitely don't come from a programming background. I studied sociology in college. But I've recently started to teach myself with free resources online and am looking to dive deeper into a possible career shift. I'd also prefer a part-time program so I can work a few times a week; however, a full-time track is doable as well. Any thoughts/comments/experiences would be very helpful! Thanks. "

codingbootcamp,Any one ever attend these boot camps?,1527013354,"I am looking into three boot camps at the moment for Full stack web development. 

Bloc
Flatiron Academy
U Penn's Coding Boot Camp

Bloc and Flatiron from what I see are self paced and have one on ones with an advisor/ mentor but the coding seems to be all on your own.

As for U Penn it is a live class environment where students are required to sit at a desk for specific hours normally in the evening and attend virtual sessions. 

Both  types of learning environments seem fitting for me as long as I get assistance and can talk to a real person when I need it. But I am looking to see if anyone has had experience with them and if it was bad or good. "

codingbootcamp,Planning to join Hack Reactor in SF with ZERO CS/coding experience. Anybody willing to share their post-bootcamp experience that is identical to mine?,1522993769,"Hello all,

As i mentioned i have no experience whatsoever in the industry. i am currently taking the prep courses which is a different story in itself.. short story its been fairly challenging.

my biggest concern and point of this post:

can anyone please share their stories with me who have been in my shoes? more specifically, came into a coding bootcamp (preferably Hack Reactor in SF but open to all stories) with no experience at all and how it turned out for you? 

As i mentioned im doing the prep courses they recommend.. but is there anything you guys would recommend me learning/looking into/preparing myself for before i actually apply (and hopefully get in)?
