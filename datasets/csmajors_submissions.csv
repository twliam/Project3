I decided to selfstudy and was wondering if anyone had good resources related to multimedia, fileformats, digitalization and data compression, whether it be books, websites or online lectures/courses, anything would be great as long as it goes deep into the topic and isn't too abstract.

Course title: Multimedia Systems

Objectives: Provides an introduction to standards and formats of multimedia content. We are teaching how to use multimedia content in software applications. Components, architectures and trends of multimedia systems are going to be surveyed.

Subject: Different types of media (text, graphic, audio, video) and their processing, their storing and their compression algorithms like MPEG or JPEG; multimedia-formats, animations, digital or interactive television, architectures of multimedia systems."

I have two software engineering internship offers for next summer (likely will be 3 next week, but I'm not counting my eggs till they hatch).

Company A:

* Series A startup (growing very fast, recently raised a very big series A from one of the top 4 VC firms)
* $40/hr compensation
* I'll be working remote from home
* Little to no name recognition, at least right now
* It'll be fast-paced work and I'll probably learn/do more
* Not sure on any return offer possibilities

Company B:

* Very large publicly-traded SaaS business ($20b+ market cap)
* $43/hr compensation
* I'll be working in-office
* Really good reputation and name recognition
* Work will likely be much more chill
* Great chance to get a full-time return offer where they pay $170k+ for new college grad SWEs

csMajors,Should I go to Gtech?,1669237619,"Right now, im a first year at Umich studying CS. I have a transfer program that guarantees acceptance into Gtech next year, so I need advice onto whether I should take it or not.

My main reasoning was because of the class selection and program orientation. There’s a dedicated school of computing at Gtech, which means the wait for classes will be smaller. I also like the specialization system, and the class selection for what I want to go into (physics engine dev / simulation dev) is much better than Michigans. Gtech is ranked higher too.

My complaints about Michigan stem from just too many people taking EECS, and how classes fill up wayyy too quickly. Also, the classes available are UMich don’t really aid me for the goals that I have. Yeah I can take a course on VSLI design, but it doesn’t help me for physics engines. 

My only worries are that: Gtech seems significantly harder than Umich, Umich has a much better alumni network to help secure a job, and transferring to en entirely different school during my second year. 

What should I do? Should I go over to Gtech ? Or bite the bullet and stay at UMich?"

Currently I'm considering three options for my future:

\- Interview for new grad positions next year, graduate and start working

\- Graduate next year and do masters

\- Double major to delay graduation by one year

I'm considering the latter two mostly because the current job market is pretty bad and I don't know if I'll be able to get a desirable offer next year. I'm pretty lost at the moment so any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

csMajors,College major crossroads - looking for your opinion,1669232131,"Hi, I am transferring to a 4 year university in the Spring after recently completing an associates degree in K-12 Education. This degree covered all my basic college classes and about 4 extra education classes. At the university I will transfer to, I am a history major with secondary teaching licensure. I also am a substitute teacher for our local public school system while I am finishing college. I live off campus with my spouse who is in the military and they plan on staying the service for a long time, which means we may have a duty station overseas in our future. 

With my current college degree plans, that would leave my only career options if we end up overseas being a remote teacher or working at a school on the overseas military base through the Department of Defense. These are solid options, but I believe computer science may be a better one for me. 

The cost per credit hour at the university I will attend is $1,039 (Out of state). So I am looking at a good $30k in debt for a history degree (about 2 more years of school) and teaching license. 

**HOWEVER**

This same university I am attending offers a 100 percent online computer science bachelors degree. **The cost? $407 per credit hour (out of state).** Also, nearly all my credits would transfer into the program and I would only have about 2 years of schooling to be done in this program, like the history one. I've always had a deep passion for computers since I was a kid. I know I am fully capable of the workload and intenseness of the degree, when compared to just a history one. Between the potential remote job opportunities in the future with a CS degree - if we end up overseas and the cost of the degree, it seems like a no brainer to me to switch. The only downside is that I will be unable to do any sort of internship, as I need to stay with my spouse and support our family. 

I'm stuck on what to do. I really like history and teaching, but the smarter option all around here seems to be switching to a CS degree. I am looking for peoples opinion on my situation. What do you guys think? Should I switch career paths? Thank you!"

I don't really care too much about the internship pay, I'm more concerned with which company I'll be able to learn more from in terms of technical knowledge and the long term prospects of potentially being a software developer for either company (aka entry level SWE salary).

Liberty Mutual's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$26/hr, have to find housing and transportation to NH office with 3k stipend, great work life balance, full time pay \~$70-100k entry level??? (on the internet it was highly variable), can choose between 7 tech tracks like backend, full stack, etc.

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, housing already provided and near transportation to office, stress-free culture, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???

I'm leaning towards Vanguard just based on the current information, but I couldn't find much information about the actual intern experiences or a constant full time SWE entry level pay for either company, so any advice or past experiences working for either company would be appreciated. Thanks!

First, they sent me a take home assignment, just creating a basic REST API that handles some JSON data. I turned it in, and got my first technical interview. The interviewer found a bug in my code, and thankfully I was able to fix it on the spot. So they told me I'd move on to the final round (onsite) and I was feeling pretty good at that point.

They sent me the itinerary, and I'll be having a DSA, system design, and OOD interview. Each an hour long. My first though was damn, pretty intense for an entry-level role. 

Thankfully, I have to learn OOD for an upcoming final, so I may have a shot there. I don't do LC though. I might could pull off an easier array or string question but anything more advanced than that and I'm fucked. And I do not know a damn thing about system design...

I'm not trying to come off like I'm complaining. I'm grateful for the opportunity, and I've got another offer lined up in case this doesn't work out. But I do feel like the initial take home (which I did well on) was the most like the actual job would be, so it would suck to lose the opportunity because I can't do LC questions. But hopefully, I can show potential in other areas and still impress them enough to get the offer."

csMajors,I highly recommend part time internships during the school year,1669224687,"So I’m doing a part time internship during the school year atm because I tend to have a lot of free time (spaced out my classes due to having a lot of credits for various reasons, try to spread out difficulty etc as well) and oh my god it’s lovely. It’s at a place I interned previously, and I feel like such a developer! Plus it’s great pay for a part time job (which is, yknow, useful as a broke college student), and I feel like the experience is great. I’m basically just doing dev work as part of one of their teams. Which I know is something you do during a summer internship too, but it’s like- all school year long work experience which I think is super useful and a lot of extra work experience.

And idk it just feels so nice to be doing dev work 🥰. I’m majoring in cs because I love programming so it genuinely is a really enjoyable way to start my day. The work I did over the summer and now is actually used at the company and in production etc and that just feels so great. After my internship over the summer it kinda sucked going back to classes because I really love doing software dev work. I do actually enjoy my classes at university too, but I really like the project work of actual software development/SWE work, and I feel like I learn a lot as an intern as well. So it’s been really nice to start back up doing intern work there (took a while to get through HR so there was a gap at the start of the school year when I wasn’t working). 

Anyway, I know the job market is rough atm (grinding for my summer internship was rough) but there are still places offering part time internships during the school year (this position wasn’t actually posted, my boss just really liked me and wanted me to keep working there, but places do have positions open as well), and it’s definitely something I recommend trying to see if you can continue doing at your summer internship if you live in the area or it was remote. I feel like a lot of people don’t think about it as an option but for me personally it’s been a really great experience!

Also am I the only one who loves feeling so professional and like an actual developer when they work an internship? I’m really looking forward to full time work in the future 

Also as my final side note: this is definitely a reflection of why it’s a good idea to try to do really good work at your internship over the summer (and have good communication and a good relationship with your boss). I highly doubt I would’ve gotten the position if my boss hadn’t really loved my work and advocated for this position to be made for me!"

I took notes during the interview, asked serious questions about the company's management/WLB/general environment, as well as technical questions like the tech stacks they use. I thought most of the conversation flowed naturally, with some pauses in between during each interview.

I think the reason that they did not give me any offers was because I didn't have enough projects to talk about, so I relied quite a bit on asking the interviewers questions. Another reason I think I may have failed is that I didn't have a lot of the skills they wanted, such as SQL or web dev experience (This was through a freshman internship matching program, so my hands were tied with that).

I am wondering if I should ask to accept the offer I turned down because I am worried my position may be closed. I do not want to be insensitive to people on here that are working hard to get offers. I feel very lucky and blessed to be in the position I am in. I do not want to take opportunities away from anyone else, however I do need to do what is best for myself.

The company I have accepted is going through some pretty massive layoffs right now. I am worried that whatever team I am assigned to will no longer have a need for an intern / the whole company takes away offers. The other company I was offered at is a bank and most likely is not very affected by the current economy the same way tech companies are. Nothing is guaranteed and I would much rather have to renege an offer then have nothing come summer time.

csMajors,How do I maximize my chances of getting an internship?,1669172049,"Hi! 

I'm having trouble finding an internship for the upcoming summer, and I want to maximise my chance of getting one, how do I do that? I have school stuff to do too, so I don't have a lot of time and thus I want to spend time doing the thing that gives me maximum return. Possible options:  

\- Just apply to as many places as I can

\- Learn something (elaborated later)

\- Practice a ton of LeetCode stuff

\- Make a project (elaborated later)

&amp;#x200B;

Stuff about me:

\- [My Resume](https://imgur.com/a/pZW8Moy) 

\- CS, Math Major, Undergrad, Sophomore in the US with meh GPA 

 \- [My 'Projects' (github.com)](https://github.com/ibzimh?tab=repositories) (Nothing too special here, most of them are just school projects)

\- Languages in order of proficiency: JavaScript, Python, Java, C

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's come back to my questions. I was thinking learning something like React or SQL or something would be helpful since many of the places I've applied to have been like we need someone who knows SQL stuffs and well react or angular or HTML/CSS etc. would be helpful and not super hard since I know JS and wouldn't have to start from the start yk.

Or maybe I should make some project because companies like those a lot.

Or maybe, considering, I'm trying to find an internship this summer and there is not a lot of time left in that, I should just apply to a shit ton of places and play the numbers game.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?"
csMajors,Optum TDP or Wells Fargo TAP (new grad),1669171366,"A couple differences are, Optum’s offer is for Irvine and Wells Fargo’s is for the Bay Area, and Optum TDP is a rotational program whereas Wells Fargo TAP isn’t. Optum also has a better TC (~15-20k higher) in a slightly lower COL area, but would require me to relocate for at least a year, which I wouldn’t have to do for Wells Fargo.

The most important factors for me (roughly in this order) are: Growth/Learning Opportunities, TC, WLB, and potential for remote/wfh. I’d also prefer to not have to relocate, but want to make the best choice for my career overall, based on the above factors, and am willing to do so if necessary.   

The plan is to stick around at either place for a couple years then try to jump the ship to a tech company.

csMajors,I'm starting to feel a lot of anxiety as a freshman CS student. Do any of you guys have any tips to deal with the anxiety?,1669171196,"I came to university with no knowledge of coding or computers. I never did extracurriculars in high school... I just got good grades, but lots of people have good grades.

I am so behind in my intro CS class. I can't focus because I have been dealing with a lot of personal things outside of school. I am trying my best and working hard yet here I am still trying to learn material we already learned in class a long time ago.

It's so intimidating and stressful and daunting seeing so many people in my class who have already been programming for such a long time. There's so many smart and intelligent and successful freshman already.

And everyone is already preparing and thinking about internships. I really want to get a cool internship one day. I really do.

I know that in order to get these cool internships at Google or Meta or Microsoft or Apple, you HAVE to start preparing and applying as soon as possible. But how am I supposed to do that when I can't even keep up with the intro CS class? I know it's stupid for me to be thinking about internships when I don't even understand recursion when I'm supposed to be analyzing algorithms. But I *have* to think about these things as soon as possible right? If I wanna actually do it?

And there's also having to worry about what extracurriculars to do. What do I spend my time on? What projects do I make? What clubs or organizations or programs am I supposed to join? What competitions do I have to win? When do I start LeetCoding? There's so many things to worry about. There's so many CS clubs at my university and I don't know what I have to look at. But at the same time... how am I supposed to join anything when I have nothing to bring to the table? I'm literally not even doing well in intro to CS... why would any club have use for me?

Everyone seems to be doing all these extracurriculars right at the gate too.

I don't know if my post is coherent at all or makes sense. But... I was honestly just looking for some wise words or advice or any comfort (if I deserve it) from any CS majors on this sub. 

Thank you."

Me: 24%

Person A: 24%

Person B: 24%

Person C: 24%

Person D: 4% or less


Person C rarely checks our group chat. She has the lightest work of all of us, and she always does things at the last minute. We work around that but it gets annoying. She has a decent bit of other coursework but every week she basically says ""she's really busy and can't do much this week."" I know what courses she's taking and it is pretty heavy but I feel there's also an aspect of lack of time management. The rest of us vary from having light coursework to a moderate amount, but everyone else at least communicates and does their stuff.


I think she's done at total of 10-12 hours of work for the project, while every else has done at least 7-10 times that amount this semester.


I refrain from saying anything because catching her up on all our changes is a hassle, and it's true she has way more coursework than I do so it feels insensitive to mention that I'm doing like 10 times the work she has done.

I know there's a really great DSA course that's made by Princeton that is taught in Java, and also Cracking the Coding Interview is also in Java. Obviously Python is also a good choice because the syntax is so simple, but I'm just not sure.

The amount of time this is taking seems a bit suspicious to me, but the super day I had was the best interview experience I had done ever, and had a good impression of the company, out of all my interviews for every year. I feel as if there could be a possibility of rescinding offers even though they're in a stable industry. 

The pay is pretty well 38/hr + $5000 sign-on bonus + 3.3k living bonus. I will have a 1.5 hour each way commuting time. 10-12 weeks Hybrid (1 to 2) days per week. 

I currently have an offer with Fidelity, a company I respect, and has a decent name on this sub as a stepping stone for FAANG. I respect them highly because I applied got a response back after 1 day, and scheduled the next interview for next week. Had the interview the next week, 2 weeks later had the final round, and after the final received an email the day after to schedule a call, and received an offer the day after. I applied to Fidelity in October and they replied so fast so that is extremely respectable. 

The Fidelity offer is not as high, but not that bad either. 37/hr + 3.3 bonus. They are only 1 hour each way. 10 - 12 weeks. Hybrid (3-5days) per 1-2 weeks per month.

csMajors,Help me decide my internship,1669145217,"I have 2 offers:

Epic Systems - 42/hr for 11 weeks, 1k relocations, corporate housing

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer
* Apparently amazing intern program, no archaic tech
* Workplace is cool (campus is amazing)
* Full time comp for area's CoL is great
* Apparently can move onto better places soon

Cons

* Winter in Madison is cold as shit
* Legacy tech, complaints about old middle management
* Full time horror stories and burnouts, lots of negative reviews
* Mostly web development, not many transferrable skills

&amp;#x200B;

BNY Mellon - 48.07/hr for 10 weeks, no reloc or housing (its in NY)

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer (95%)
* Fintech experience and big bank name
* WLB apparently good for fulltime
* Mediocre intern program

Cons

* No housing, NY rent will kill me
* Apparently can't really boost you into fintech
* Possible use of old tech, depends on project
* Full time comp not great (esp in NY)
* Not particularly organized

&amp;#x200B;

Epic would net me 18480 + 1000 - plane tix

BNY would net me 19228 - about 5-6k in rent

BNY would be a lot less money, but in this economy I just want a solid return offer, which both seem to promise. If anyone knows anything about BNY's START program or Epic's internship and anything about their fulltime and which would be better for my career, please let me know.

- lib is in new hampshire but they’d give me a housing stipend
- i don’t have much technical experience and i’m afraid lockheed will expect me to come in w a certain amount of knowledge (i didn’t do any technical interviews tho)
- lib seems like they have a bigger and more diverse program? i don’t know much about lockheed

**Option A:** F500 SWE Full time 

* By some luck, I got a full time SWE job before graduating because my first degree was kind of related to CS.
* Comp: $80k MCOL

Pros:

* Long term. Can earn money for a longer period than a summer 
* Stable industry and don't have to wait to see how bad the economy is in Fall 2023
* More responsibilities than an internship. 

Cons:

* Comp is lower than FAANG comp if I were to get a return offer from FAANG 
* Not a tech company 

**Option B:** FAANG Internship

Pros:

* Increased chance of getting a full time return offer at FAANG  

Cons:

* Only a summer internship. I have to find other work after my internship ends... Basically need to find another job for 9 months until Spring 2024

We’re also not familiar with the language. And currently I don’t even have the option of working on it as we don’t have access to the Git repo, no one does. This has been communicated. My main concern is that it’s pretty obvious no one knows anything about the project other than that person.

Pros:

* much more interesting work
* perhaps more recognizable 

Cons:

* Currently only a conditional offer, need to acquire ts/sci security clearance which I've heard is a long process 
* Location

Software Development Intern @ Defense Contractor ($28/hr) 

Pros: 

* More applicable to SWE
* Way better location, in my hometown so I could live with my family and see my friends
* No Security Clearance process needed

Cons:

* Work is less interesting, just general run of the mill software development at a big company
* Probably not recognizable to many

Currently I'm thinking of accepting the Defense internship then reneging if I'm able to obtain clearance. I just find the work at the NSA way cooler and interesting and since I'm a freshmen I'll have many more chances for swe experience. This is probably not relevant but I'm also interested in quant trading in the future.

csMajors,Am I screwed if I am bad at SQL?,1669074184,"I am currently taking an SQL class right now. I thought it was going to be a very easy class, but it turns out it is by far my hardest class of the semester. It makes my data structures class seem like a cake walk. That is not to say that I have put more time into my SQL class than my data structures class, but I just hate writing queries.

That is all it has been so far is writing queries. I feel like I am able to decently visualize things such as data structures and algorithms using real programming languages like C++ and assembly, but I just can't visualize what is going on in SQL.

I will try to watch videos on it, and they do very simple queries (so the videos are useless), while in my class the queries are insane. Every lesson builds on the last, so I am starting to get behind. I somehow got a 100 on the second midterm which is keeping me afloat, and I am sitting at like an 88 right now, but it will surely drop and I am used to getting all A's.

I hate this class so much. Nothing frustrates me as much as SQL. It feels like the language keeps you from doing things that should work. I just want to put my fist through a wall over and over again while doing my assignments. Every question is combinations of  different types of joins, subqueries, window functions, etc, etc... 

I have heard that many jobs will ask complex interview question on SQL. I did some SQL during my internship, but it was mostly just adding or removing stuff to/from tables. Once this course is over I really don't want to even have to consider writing a query again, but it seems that it is a necessary skill. At this point I have practically given up and think I am just going to take the L on my grade. Fuck SQL to hell.

Am I going to be at a major disadvantage?"

csMajors,Is it too late? Need more time to be ready,1669070947,"I've applied to over 80 companies, but my main mistake was not doing LC over the summer. Focusing on submitting applications, taking my courses, and extra curriculars has killed me and I haven't really had time to work on leetcode. I haven't done well on most of the OA's I've been given. These next couple weeks I have some more time so I'm going to do as much prep as I can, and after finals I'll go ham over winter break. 

Is it too late for me? I feel like most of the good companies have already made their decisions. If I get some OA and interview opportunities after the break I will definitely be ready, but I just feel like it's way too late at this point. I'm a junior with a pretty good resume so I have my fingers crossed that one of the companies will reach out next semester..."
csMajors,Internship or transfer early? Need advice please,1669069370,"Hello! So i just today received an internship related to computer science (yay!) but I am now wondering if I should accept it or possibly transfer early.
 So a little backstory. I was originally going to transfer in spring 2024 to a CSU (i go to a community college). Well I found out recently that more classes are required to transfer with an ADT which would increase my time here at community college by a whole year (i have been here for 3 years already and am dying to transfer). I could transfer into fall 2023 potentially to a CSU but that means I wouldn't be able to take the internship. This decision to transfer was made after I applied as I was not aware before. I am not sure if I would get in but I'm hoping I will? I am a local student to both CSUs I applied to and have a 3.9 GPA. 
Should I take an extra semester in community college for the internship? Or just transfer asap. If I choose to transfer I can also get a head start and take some summer classes as well which I like. Thank you for any advice :)"

However, my goal is to move to the US asap.

As a new grad, I'll be graduating with 7 internships. RBC Amplify (Summer 2023), RBC Capital Markets (Winter 2023), IBM (Summer 2022), BlackBerry (Winter 2022), OpenText (Fall 2021), and 2 startups (Summer 2021, Winter 2021).

I was able to pull this off because school was online during covid, and I attend a shit-tier university in Ontario.


Having said that, how realistic would it be for me to land a role in the US as a new grad, or maybe 2 years out?

I'm leetcoding like crazy rn, so that when new grad apps role out in around 8 months, I'll be very well prepared. On top of that, I'm studying systems design.

Oh, and I'm a Canadian citizen btw 


Thanks alot everyone!"

I avoided tutorials because I always felt more overwhelmed when my teacher explained things to me.

I decided that I still wanted to try to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but I'm beginning to reconsider as I look at my degree plan. I wanted to transfer to a larger university to pursue CS there, but the upper-level classes look really intimidating and I don't know if I'll be mentally ready to take them by the time I transfer. I won't even begin taking my programming classes until next Summer, but I already feel anxious.

So I’m currently nearing the end of my first semester of high school and I’m looking at my college apps and they don’t look too good. 

I’ve always been planning on pursuing a degree in compSci , preferably for robotics, but that might change in the future. 

The dream college I wanted to go to is most likely not going to happen, and the other colleges that are still worth it to go to, but I’d rather stay at home because of the cost benefit and social aspects as I know a lot of friends here. 
My current plan right now is to put just enough effort into school to graduate and focus most of my effort towards study in compSci then getting into a Compsci camp like hack reactor or code smith over the summer but I am not sure of the viability of this plan or if there are better options for me. I’m either planning on using thar code academy to hopefully transfer into my dream college next year, or go into a better job then I would have gotten from going to the collage near home. 

I was wondering if anyone else has tried this plan before or if anyone had any help/critiques, there were willing to provide. Money towards education isn’t a problem for me as thankfully I have parents who can pay.

big question are. Is this possible? Am I rushing into things too quickly? Any resources to help me study compSci? Any alternatives to hack actor or coach Smith that are available online over the summer? What would y’all do?"

csMajors,Construction Management minor to compliment my major?,1668995330,"Hi all, I'm a second year CS major who is yet to decide on a minor. My father works as a high level manager at a large construction company and suggested that I pursue a construction management minor? 

This is a very tech heavy company that is huge on incorporating technology into every area of the business that they can. 

I'm aware that this minor would only benefit me if i were to pursue a career in the construction industry, but the starting pay is much higher than that of a standard SWE in my area and the obvious connection I have to the company would likely help me to at the very least get an interview. 

I know a job at a FAANG company is all the rage on Reddit, but does anyone else have a similar plan for their degree? Just looking for additional insight into whether there may be a better minor to pursue."

csMajors,Yet another frustrating post,1668987701,"I am graduating in spring 2023.

I started this academic year pretty relaxed and thought that I would start job hunting in January. Still, I applied to a few jobs and received some interview calls. Out of those, I got to the final rounds of two, but got rejected from both. I guess I could have done better if I prepared well enough. Instead I put more emphasis on academics.

After two rejections from final rounds I started applying seriously and received only rejections and ghosting. Finally a week ago a company sent an OA which I did very poorly (although I did extremely well on the practice tests). I am questioning all of my skills now and feeling like I am not fit for the field. Also the regret for messing up the two final rounds is killing me. I am an international student and I attend one of top 4 CS schools. This is making it even worse because I can't help feeling that I absolutely don't deserve to be in this school. And on top of everything, my family is completely depending on me getting a decent job right after graduation. Well, it is what it is."

My project (a backend and frontend involved project) got blocked quite a few times, especially as some of my managers/senior engineers/etc. disagreed on how to go about certain parts of the project, and I was set back a couple of weeks.

I got my first bachelor’s degree in psychology (overall university ranked at \~20 and psychology program ranked at \~10 by US News and World Report). During my psychology degree, I was a research assistant for multiple years, secured research grants, and coauthored some psych journal articles.

After graduating with my first degree, I immediately began and finished a second bachelor’s degree in computer science at a mid-tier university (overall university ranked at \~50 and CS program ranked at \~50 by US News and World Report).

After finishing the second degree, I’ve been working as a software engineer at a small tech company for about a year (recruiters would not consider this company as prestigious and most have probably never heard of the company).

I will be applying to new software engineering jobs soon. Should I hide my non-CS degree and my prior non-CS experience when I apply for jobs? Is there a stigma against career changers? During my first job hunt, many of the interviewers said that based off my resume it seemed like I was really interested in research as opposed to software engineering (“Your resume screams research”) and they asked questions about why I switched from psych to CS."

csMajors,$118k student loans to get Masters?,1668975955,"There’s a news article running today about people not wanting to pay their loans. Several people are profiled.

Not to downplay the importance of a CS degree or to throw shade at the schools mentioned, but is that seriously how much it should cost? I’ve seen literally thousands of pathways to a high paying job in tech and paying more than $100k is not a thing I’ve seen before unless tied to an A tier school.  I’m wondering if this guy was cherry picked by the writers. 
There’s a whole separate conversation about the morality of getting student loans and not paying them and of the potentially predatory student loan machine in general, but I’m not asking about that or whether this person is a victim here. My question is just about whether it’s a justifiable expense given the availability of excellent training/education for lower price points."

csMajors,Can’t even do a leetcode easy after 9 months of studying. Please criticize my study habits?,1668970030,"I’m not even trolling, this is actually my situation. 

Quick background / how I “studied”


I started studying February 19th. I started off paying for leetcode premium and trying to learn the basics off of there. I remember making handwritten notes of these basics but I cannot find them. I learned hash tables, stacks, queues, linkedlist, and binary search trees. 

Then, May 14th, I watched one youtube video from a guy with pretty poor beginner advice (ex. Don’t code until you know how to solve the problem, as if you can do an entire technical interview in your head), and structured my studying for the next couple months around his questions.I attempted a leetcode hard the very next day (word search II) and just copied the code once from some youtube video and left the problem. I even left a note saying “I don’t understand”. 

Then, i transitioned into   https://neetcode.io/practice , and attempted problems while using neetcodes youtube videos. I copied code and every time I  copied, i followed these rules:
Rule 1. Don’t write any code until you know how to solve the problem
Draw it out while talking through it in english
Psuedocode
Then code

What ended up happening, on every single coding question, was that i always skipped A and B because you didn’t know how to talk through or psuedocode the problem, and went straight to C, copying down code. 

My comments consist of text straight from the video, but i never really had deep understanding of how to solve the problem, and I didn’t try to solve the problem on my own with no help after i seen the solution. I drew out code on white boards and took pictures of it, put all my code in intellij, but I still never really attempted problems yourself with no help because i never knew how. 

I upgraded the way I approached problems and did it systematically, and this was the system i developed: 

Rule 1. Write down the name of the problem and what the problem is asking for

Rule 2. Draw it out while talking it through in english(use previously written documents steps 2-4)

Rule 3. Pseudocode 

Rule 4. Code. 

Rule 5. View solution and run it in intellij to see if it works. Watch it once and pretend you’re the guy in the video, mock what he’s saying. Then watch it again while coding and making comments. 

Rule 6. Whiteboard

Rule 7.  Answer the final question, “What is one thing I could have known or done that would have made everything else easier?”

Rule 8. Write working code in notebook

Notice how i never attempted the problem myself wit no help. I ran it in intellij to make sure it worked, wrote it on the whiteboard, and then moved on. I never really learned how to solve the problem, i only learned how to copy the answer.


WHAT I THINK I’M DOING WRONG

First things first, my studying is disorganized. I’m pulling from different sources, not writing things down, not writing clear notes, etc. 

I also notice a lack of consistency. I started learning the basics on leetcode, and then never finished any category above 55%(arrays, graphs, hash tables, BST’s). I don’t even know where my handwritten notes are. 

Then, from February 19th, there is a large gap of time where I can’t find evidence that i even attempted to do anything, and then, may 14th, almost three months later, I watch one youtube video from some guy with pretty poor beginner advice, and then attempted a leetcode hard the next day.

Then I spent the next couple months copying problem solutions I didn’t understand in my notebook. 

tl;dr - used YouTube videos I didn’t understand to “study”, and by study, I mean copy solutions without understanding them. I still don’t know how to do a leetcode easy 9 months later. What can I change, what resources can I use, how can I do better?"

Obviously the position have nothing to do with IT, and some people can be a little iffy about the line of work. But I have definitely learned a lot of useful skills that I think can apply to CS such as handling customer satisfaction, following rigorous schedule, and handling stressful situation (especially when dealing with the Cartel members). And tbh, I'm quite proud of it as part of my heritage as well, my grandpa had been smuggling people from Germany and Italy to Argentina since the 1940s.

csMajors,"What computer scientists have advocated for freely publicizing detailed solutions, to every exercise?",1668917902,"### Besides the 2 mathematicians quoted below and me, who else has touted free dissemination ***to students*** of detailed solutions, to EVERY exercise and problem (like in textbooks)? I uphold this wholeheartedly! This free dissemination ought to be the norm! 

#### I do NOT refer to snippety one-line answers at the back of a textbook, student solution manuals that solve merely some or half of the exercises, or solution manuals  restricted to instructors. 

 1. Robert  Ash (1935-2015), [Preface](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV/RVPreface.pdf) to [*Real Variables with Basic Metric Space Topology*](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~r-ash/RV.html).

 &gt;I rely especially on one of the most useful of all learning devices: the inclusion of detailed solutions to exercises. Solutions to problems are commonplace in elementary texts but quite rare (although equally valuable) at the upper division undergraduate and graduate level. This feature makes the 
book suitable for independent study, and further widens the audience. 

 2. David Patrick, *Introduction to Counting and Probability* (2005), page v. 

&gt;However, 
if you are using this book on your own to learn independently, then you probably have a copy of the 
solution book, in which case there are some very important things to keep in mind: 
&gt;
&gt;1. Make sure that you make a serious attempt at the problem before looking at the solution. Don't 
use the solution book as a crutch to avoid really thinking about a problem first. You should think 
*hard* about a problem before deciding to give up and look at the solution. 
&gt;
&gt;2. **After you solve a problem, it's usually a good idea to read the solution, even if you think you know 
how to solve the problem. The solution that's in the solution book might show you a quicker or 
more concise way to solve the problem, or it might have a completely different solution method 
that you might not have thought of. [emboldening mine]** 
&gt;
&gt;3. If you have to look at the solution in order to solve a problem, make sure that you make a note of 
that problem. Come back to it in a week or two to make sure that you are able to solve it on your 
own, without resorting to the solution."

csMajors,GM vs L3Harris Internship Decision,1668915878," Hello everybody, I´m looking for some help deciding between GM and L3Harris for an internship for next summer.

For context, I´m a junior currently, and am looking to get into software engineering. No matter which of these two I pick, I plan on applying for new grad roles next year in the hopes of landing a more lucrative SWE role at a different company, as neither GM nor L3Harris pays too well.

This means the biggest factor for me is what would look better on my resume when I apply for full-time roles next year.

Details about the offers:

GM:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Warren (Detroit), Michigan. Global Technical Center.
3. Pay: Don't know yet as I have only received the verbal offer thus far. I expect it to be about the same as L3Harris
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~95k

L3Harris:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Dallas, Texas
3. Pay: $29/hour, plus $3,000 lump sum housing stipend.
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~85k--fewer datapoints to go off of.

I don't really know what I'll be working on at either of these two companies either. Just looking for any bits of advice, especially as to which one of these two opportunities would look better on a resume applying to full-time SWE roles at top companies.

I'm currently a Canadian graduating senior in a non-CS major (bio), and for the past 3 years I've been deciding between medical school and software engineering. 2 summers ago I did Microsoft Explore, but reneged on my SWE return offer (yes I know, an absolute MORON move) for this summer as I got a research internship that I thought would help for medical school. Fast forward to this summer and I realized I HATE the idea of the grind associated with medicine, but now I'm fucked because I literally threw away the perfect opportunity to get into big tech.

So, now I'm trying to pivot back into tech and apply for SWE internships for winter 2023 or summer 2023 (which will delay my graduation but probably put me on track for a return NG), or SWE FT (suboptimal as I really wanted an in-person internship), but sadly both of these are pretty difficult. I thought I would have more luck with getting interviews with the Microsoft name on my resume, but I guess given my relative lack of experience and the current economy AND the fact I need sponsorship, it's no surprise I haven't gotten anything. Would you suggest going for a second bachelor's (something to do with CS this time?), or a CS masters, or just grind it out and hope for a job? Any advice on what I should do with my life lol ..."

so we just started learning about amortized analysis (the accounting method and the potenial method) and Im having hard time with this.

1. in effort to try and see more exampples (right now in class we saw only 2 examples for amortized analysis) I found this lect notes:  
 [lect0922.pdf (cmu.edu)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/451f11/lectures/lect0922.pdf)   
Im having a bit of problem with 7.6 (example 3-page 4) "" . Now, in a sequence of n increments, a single increment could cost as much as n (actually 2n − 1) ""  
why its actually 2n-1 ? I feel like Im missing ""basic"" stuff here  
if we look at 000  
to flip A\[2\] (the leftmost digit)  
001  
010  
011  
100  
and it took us 4 times  
is it because in the accounting method we consider each inceremnt as cost of 2?  

2. in general the potenial method is a bit ""heavy"" for my understanding, Im having trouble understanding how to know what potenial function to give, I find it a bit hard to find examples online (mostly find the same 3/4 examples in every place)  
if someone has reccomendation where to read/see examples would love to hear(trying to read through clrs, but I feel like I need to see more examples of how to come up with potenial function, especially with O(log n) and O(n\^2)

I think that the constant cycle of being close to getting a role and passing technicals and OAs to rejections made me develop anxiety issues that I've been noticing recently. It's probably a result of constantly going down rabitholes of thoughts on how the decisions were made about me.

I keep having paranoid thoughts about people hating me and I just freaked out at my friend because I thought he suddenly started hating me for some reason and it's all over a late reply to a text. I know it sounds crazy now but in my head at the moment it sounded so plausible that I confronted him about it.

csMajors,Riot Games Interview Process,1668852725,"posting this bc I wish I had something like this throughout the process. Hopefully someone can benefit from it.

Submitted app early September, offer mid November

Notes:

OA: For the 90 minute OA, focus on code reusability. The questions build upon each other and you should be copying your methods from one problem to another. Not really leetcode-esque. Keep some sort of note about your OA code either afterward in a doc or just simply recreate it in another editor for reference for the technical interview. I got 34/35 cases

Phone Screen: The phone screen is a broad 30 minute culture fit to see where you fall. Asked about my gaming history and prior work experience. They were  transparent in telling me what teams my skills aligned with. This decision sets up who you’ll be interviewing with for the next rounds. Otherwise they might place you with whoever they think you fit with. 

Technical Round: I think I got lucky for the technical screen. This 60 minute interview goes over your OA answer and asks some basic DSA questions about it. I got sent my OA results from my recruiter which gave me a lot of time to revise my solution, find optimizations, and just understand my own sloppy code to explain to the interviewer. Without this, I don’t think I would have passed this round. This interviewer was a nice Engineering Manager and stayed 20 minutes over to talk about Riot.

Behavioral Round: The first 60 minute values behavioral interview without an engineer was extremely chill. Not the most conversational interview but I only received generic behavioral questions which were easy. Always frame answers in the S.A.O format and try to exemplify Riot’s values when you can. My interviewer really appreciated this. In terms of preparation, I won’t lie I may have gone overkill. I made a doc answering potentially every question I could get asked, why I wanted to intern at riot, etc. It was nice when I could quickly spin up an example that I prepared after being asked a question. Helped me get through a lot of questions.

Hiring manager round: Scheduled for 60 ended in 30. Was critical about my responses which made me fumble my words sometimes. A big focus on Value Alignment. The questions may seem random but they care more about the way you frame your answer than the actual response imo. For example “tell me about a goal of yours”, they care about how you define goals and execute them rather than the actual goal. It’s all about how you think and if that mindset aligns with the team/company. I ran out of questions to ask so instead of fabricating my interest I just thanked them for their time.

Closing thoughts: This whole process is half soft skills and half luck imo. I suck at leetcode and I don't have the strongest technical background. I just did my research on the company, spent time to be able to explain my past experiences, and had some interviewers I clicked with."

Hi,
I'm an international prospective student thinking of applying for a Masters in CS in the US &amp; Canada. Looking at the macro economic conditions like Tech layoffs, likely _mild_ recession, the Ukraine conflict, I'm confused as to whether to apply or not.

I'm done with all my exams (GRE/IELTS), documents and everything. I just have to submit my applications and I think I'm getting cold feet.

So, my questions are:

1. What are the intern opportunities in Summer of 24 and beyond? 

2. What would be the state of hiring by 2024-25?

3. Is it worth it to let go of my current SWE job in my home country for pursuing this?

The other option I have is to wait an year out and apply for Fall 2024.

My ultimate goal would be to do as many internships as possible (helping me to understand various fields within tech itself) during my masters and land a good role for FTE."

csMajors,Future of Tech?,1668834711," Currently in third year studying Computer Engineering hoping to peruse a career in SWE. With all the talks about the recession, culture resets, and yes state of Twitter I am getting pretty worried. Seems like saturation is at its highest levels I think for SWE. Is this the start where tech/swe starts to dwindle? Does anyone have any tips on how to focus on a niche or choosing one perhaps to help with the odds and maybe stand out? I am starting to even consider a post-secondary program because of this, but I am unsure how worth that is. I am currently in a co-op program where I have to do 6 terms=2 years of internship experience to graduate, which can help but the jobs I have only gotten so far were pretty general full-stack ones, nothing that can help me stand out super out of the crowd.

I am pretty passionate about SWE, and yes of course money is also an incentive. I am mainly interested in distributed systems and would love to pursue that. The whole web3 blockchain space interests me as well, specifically in the distributed systems aspect. But of course I cannot tell if this is just a fad and will last.

But yeah honestly not sure if I am just overreacting, I got another 2 years to graduate and stressing out for no reason. Any advice, input and reality checks are greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Should I focus on one, try to do both, or do something else entirely? Any advice? I would like to, at least, try the things that would allow me to have the strongest resume possible by next summer/fall."
csMajors,Not getting better at leetcode,1668768612,So I’ve been practicing for a while (did half of the the 75 blind list) and some other questions but I can’t seem to get better at problem solving. I also don’t have the time to dedicate an hour or two to fully do one problem by myself so I tend to just watch videos and the answers for each lc problem. Any tips/strategies on how to improve my understanding and problem solving?
csMajors,Gusto 90 minute work session,1668768313,"Hi all, 

Wondering what to expect for this 90 minute work session which is the technical part of the final round. I’d be really grateful for any pointers. I know we have to help solve something like a real world problem, but 90 minutes? Do I need to know sys design? Should I be comfortable with making API calls on the spot? Language choice? Difficulty? I saw in one place that it was just data parsing or something but idk how much truth there is to that.

Also, is the behavioral super standard?"
csMajors,Capital One compensation is underestimated,1668767279,"I’ve seen a lot of posts slandering Capital One full time pay and there seemed to be a lot of misinformation (I give a theory/reason why at the end of the post). I interned there last summer and her is the exact return offer I got. This is for the McLean office.

First year TC: $146,800 - 150,100
Breakdown:
Base salary - $127,000
Sign on - $15,000
Performance - $6,600 (target/average - $3,300)
Relocation - $1,500 (wasn’t sure if I should include but it’s there)

Second year TC: $130,300 - 133,600
Breakdown:
Same as above but no sign on or relocation.

After the second year you graduate the TDP and become an actual engineer but I don’t know the numbers for this.
 
I could be wrong but I think levels.fyi has some way of “spreading out” or discounting the sign on bonus (I don’t frequent levels so someone can explain how they get there number one the comments). The number on levels.fyi for the McLean office is accurate if you don’t count the sign on.

For New York and SF the compensation is likely 10-15k higher."

csMajors,frustration and disappointment in myself,1668751677,"hey everyone, let me preface this with my background: rising junior, 3.8 GPA, go to a top 5 school (uc berk), and i have previous internship experience. i also teach an upper-division class at uni, and i have 4 solid projects on my resume (React web app, generative ML MVG model from scratch w/ python+numpy+pandas+datacleaning, java clone of git, and a computation data/thread parallelism with C)

coding stats: 

1. codesignal 841 (just got this 2 days ago, failed databricks, roblox, zoom, and instabase with 780, so it's too late anyways)
2. solved 89 LC questions w/ distribution 26 easy/57 med/6 hards (finished all non-LC-premium problems on blind 75 except 3 hards) 

i started applying september 29th, and now i have applied to 208 places, received 33 OAs, 12 of which I got a perfect score on. Of which, i only received 3 interviews, and i've failed 1 and only have 2 left. this is my first mistake - applying late september, when the gold was during late july + early august.

i am writing this after failing doordash interview: i know my mistake, and it's just a skill issue - at this point, i am more angry than anything else. i spend many hours thinking over LC questions and talking to people at my school, but i'm not improving at all. i know i'm not improving simply because of my performance - everyone else knows how to solve these simple ass questions, but in that doordash interview, i had 1 question which i understood but could not implement, and i'm kicking myself everyday for it. my classes/sleep are suffering so much. 

tbh, i could care less about what jobs my friends had (so many classmates are going to insane firms), that's not causing me my negative emotions - i'm so angry and disappointed because i am not getting better. i am always missing a little bit, and despite what i do - day by day i'm at the same skill level. i try to put my anger into my studies, and there are days where i sit in the library for 17 hours drinking soylent as my meals trying to grind harder and harder. i don't think i will burn out because im so desparate for improvement - i just keep imagining what it feels like to have a future and that is the biggest motivator of them all, but it is not enough

if anyone has ever plateaued in life so hard, please share how you climbed out. i'm looking to any advice to get unstuck and make progress"

csMajors,New Grad/Early Career (International) - Never give up.,1668748927,"I can't count how many applications I made... Here's the journey.

Non-CS Eng bachelor (outside of US) =&gt; took CS undergrad fundamentals (non-degree) =&gt; CS MS from 2020.

No internship till May 2022. (I didn't think it seriously because I didn't have experience getting a job in the US and how much it is important to have internship experience for getting a job)

I was supposed to graduate in May 2022. But I failed to get any offer. Summary is

* Application total: 600 (backend, data science, machine learning...new grad that doesn't provide any specific area)
* Internship: Nothing
* Project: one class project
* LC: 250 (easy: 150, medium: 100, hard: 0)
* Codesignal: 842 (I was lucky...)
* Major results: eBay final, Bloomberg final, Adobe final, Lucid (chart) final. MAANG: resume screened. 20\~30 automating OA companies.

Since I didn't have any offers, it was very risky to graduate without any offers. So I deferred my graduation to this Dec 22.

I tried to equip myself with a few things.

* internship: got a start-up internship this summer, and found another internship this fall.
* ground LC: so far 1200 (easy 300, medium: 700, hard: 200)
* learned frontend part (javascript, typescript, swift) and DB (SQL) - did toy projects
* prepared individual projects at least one for the area I apply (frontend, backend, iOS, general NG SWE)
* prepared different versions of my resume: for general, frontend, data science, ML, data engineer

However, the situation dramatically changed... economic recession and I felt it was harsher for international students who required sponsorship (at least, a person who should answer 'yes' to the question 'do you need a sponsorship now or in the future?' although they didn't stick to sponsorship concerning this economic situation). As a result...

* Application total: 1,000 (a little bit more than that... from the time over 400, I didn't count it but set doing it as one of the everyday morning routines. visit LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Angel.co, RippleMatch, and two or three more)
   * general SWE including backend specific, frontend specific: approx 700
   * data science: 100
   * ML: 100
   * data engineer: 100
   * iOS: 20
* Target position:
   * new grad: 600
   * early career or job description says like this: 400
* Codesignal: 840\~849
* Triplebyte: excellent (DS, Algo, python, javascript), great (react, swift)
* Hackerrank: solved everything with efficient time/space complexity
* Summary:
   * MAANG: ghosted (Microsoft explicitly rejected me)
      * AWS: did phone interview and invited to virtual on-site but pending (unlimited...)
   * Companies I was in the final round in the previous: resume screened (interesting...)
   * Unicorn (or famous tech companies): resume screened
   * As a result, among 1,000 applications =&gt; 10 OAs =&gt; 3 phones =&gt; 2 on-sites =&gt; 1 offer

I guess there are many folks who are actively looking for an offer. Especially for those who inevitably should graduate in Dec with F1 status, I would say  I know how stressful it is... 

My word from my testimonial is ... never to give up. There is definitely a job for you if you never give up. The only thing you don't know now is when/where/what."

4. Print binary search tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.

Reasons to choose C1: high return offer rate (important to me given the economic uncertainty in the next year), bigger intern cohort / well-run internship program, good work-life balance, intern housing included. I'm also a bit concerned about Robinhood's recent layoffs and general instability over the past year.

Reasons to choose Robinhood: higher new-grad compensation ($200k vs $120k), might stand out more on resume, interesting projects, flexibility to be remote most days of the week

I feel so unbelievably burnt out and depressed, and I’m thinking it’s not worth my sanity to continue. 

I feel as though the assignment is just out of my ability, considering the amount of time I put into it and how hard I’ve tried to get everything working. It’s easily the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do at university, and we were given two weeks to do it, the second week being exam week. If I don’t hand it up, it’s likely I’ll fail the course if I didn’t ace the exam as it’s worth 30%. 

I’ve maintained excellent grades for everything else so far, but this one class has broken me. My girlfriend and family have all been really worried about me, and I’ve been going to sleep every night tossing and turning thinking about ways I could get it working.

I have been getting mixed reactions from people around me on whether school I should commit to. SJSU is definitely incomparable location-wise for a career opportunity but VT seems to have more prestige for its CS program across the nation. I have been coding mostly in JAVA and my plan is to intern in the Summer of 2024 as a backend software engineer on the CPT status, graduate in Spring 2025, and be employed on an OPT status.

I am really focused on getting into the industry right after graduation without considering doing Masters in CS. Thus, I am personally preferring SJSU at the moment for its location and tuition, but I am also open to other thoughts and opinions that could change my mind.

Will I really be more exposed to career opportunities at SJSU despite the prestige title of graduating from VT?

I am having a hard time deciding because it seems Millennium has the highest prestige (but people don't generally know about it and worse culture), while Expedia has the new grad rotational program and high return offer rate. I also really enjoyed talking to my interviewers at Yext and think it's a good company as well. Location wise, I prefer DC &gt; NYC &gt; Chicago because Yext's location is super close to my sister and that would make my summer more fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Accenture's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$32/hr, mix of project management + data analysis + coding (highly dependent on project), mixed work life balance (highly dependent on project), culture of ""work hard play hard"", full time pay \~$70-90k entry level???, more well known?

&amp;#x200B;

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, more coding focused (based on recent Linkedin users' descriptions), stress-free, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???, assignments project based

&amp;#x200B;

When I checked Glassdoor and other career review sites, both companies had mixed reviews and a lot of things were highly variable, so any advice or past experiences working for either company would be appreciated. Thanks!

Proximity to DC (Not sure if this is strong enough to outweigh VTech tho)


Hopefully the proximity to DC means more opportunities for part time software engineer internships during the school year

- Cons
Commuter school

Lower ranked CS program

V tech:
- Pros 
Higher ranked program
Not a commuter school

Reasoning: Roblox only converts 50% of interns to full-time. There's job stability by taking an internship at a big bank in the case of a recession.

Also, I'm unsure of how well-known Roblox is in non-tech industries. The tech industry will probably continue to take a beating through 2023, and I may have to find full-time work at a non-tech company.

csMajors,Appian vs. Tanium Intern,1668645126,"Currently have offers for both companies as a junior in college. Having such a hard time deciding because of remote vs. in-person and company work.

**Appian**

Right off the bat, Appian culture seems impressive. They are an old public company. They flew me out for an explore HQ day, and I felt the company valued developing young talent so they could be prepared in the workplace. The campus is also great, and many employees work at the office daily.

My concerns are the hourly rate, and they seem to be using outdated tech stacks that might limit relevant learning. Furthermore, McLean is not the best location, and the new-grad return salary is lower than industry standards.

**Tanium**

Tanium is an old Unicorn. The company also seems to have great talent and a similarly decent product. It is also private with a distant IPO opportunity, but I am unsure whether it will become public anytime soon.

For Tanium, I am concerned about working remotely as I have worked remotely before, and it was such a bad experience in terms of mentorship and growth. They said I could move near their Emeryville Office, but most of their employees are remote.

My goal for the summer is to grow professionally as much as possible. I have no idea which route I should take. Does anyone have any advice for me? I appreciate you all so much. Comments would be SOOO appreciated.

csMajors,Should I delay graduation?,1668645070,"I wanted some advice and insight on what I should do. So I'm actually a freshman but because of credits and stuff I can graduate from next year I am hesitant because I don't have much internship experience and I would ideally like to get into a big tech-esque company or like C1 for example.  

Here are my current options -

1) Graduate Early and try to find full-time roles.

2) Graduate early and go to graduate school (I will prob have to take out loans)

3) Delay graduation by a year to do internships.

4) Delay graduation by two years to do internships.

csMajors,"How can I engage more with my major, other than building projects?",1668642689,"So in high school I took biology and chemistry, and I graduated in 2020. So whenever I was reading about covid and the vaccines I could relate it to what I was studying. I am currently doing a CS major with an econ minor, and I can relate to my econ minor by reading the news. Is there any way I can read about applications of what I am learning in my CS major, whether it be algorithms and data structures and how they're applied to real life software, or how software design is used in real software? 

Whenever I am studying through my lecture notes or watching a YouTube video explaining a concept, there is always a hypothetical example being given. I get why this is, as most software is confidential and so it would be tough to see how algorithms and everything else is used in them. But there surely has to be a way for there to be more concrete examples of what I am learning. I know the best way to learn is to apply the concepts, which I am trying to do, but I feel like it would severely help my abilities and interests in what I'm doing if I could HOW these concepts are used in things I actually use in real life, akin to how a materials science major would be able to understand the aluminum alloys that build airplanes.

-I am a sophomore CS student at a Top 30 State University

-I have previous experience in IT Support intern (last summer + this fall), and 1 semester of being a Math TA

-This spring I will be doing a Co-op position as a Data Engineer at a mid sized healthcare+technology company for $24 an hour, (seems to be only using Microsoft Azure, Power BI, and SQL Servers) and not sure if I will be able to use any programming languages. Also will be a grader for a python data structures class this spring

Anyways, I had originally thought i was graduating in Spring 2024 which made me really push for an internship this summer, however my advisor is advising that I should take summer courses this Summer 2023 and go for an internship next Summer 2024. The main reason why she thinks I should do my summer courses now is due to the fact that certain classes aren't offered every summer, and it is best I take them while I can before I get to Summer 2024 and my required courses aren't being offered at that time. Going through with this, I believe I would have a greater chance at receiving an internship for next summer as I'd have more preparation time and a better GPA to help my apps.  I could really just use some opinions on this, considering the current job market, hiring freezes and whatnot, along with me not trusting my school the most when it comes to this kind of stuff."

The most interesting to me are Machine Learning, Full-Stack Web Development, and AR/VR Development.

I am leaning most towards FS, however, I'm definitely struggling, so here are the arguments for and against each one:

- Full Stack Web Development:
    - Jobs everywhere
    - Remote positions common
    - Skills are ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" (I will be learning Front-end, Back-end, and Middle-ware, which means I will likely not know any of them *well*)

    - Moderately interested (especially for the prospect of remote work)

- Machine Learning
    - Not as many jobs (?)
    - Very abstract
    - Higher earning potential in the long run (?)
    - Less interested
    - Only use Python (pro or con?)

- AR/VR Development
    - Most interested
    - Least prospect of getting a job?

csMajors,MSFT Interview Experience (Offer received),1668550533,"Hi! Hopefully this is allowed. I always found it super helpful to read other people's experiences, so I wanted to share mine :)  !

So I did the New Tech program last summer (if you're a freshman or sophomore I HIGHLY recommend it) and as such, moved directly to final round interviews for MSFT. I finished the program back in early August, and just now interviewed. With hiring freezes and all this tech stuff the folks in the program were really fighting for us, and I'm crazy thankful that they were able to advance all the New Techs to the final round— they really do watch out for the people who do it. But I had my interview yesterday, which went something like this:

11:20: Did a ""sign in"" call, where we went over the logistics of the interview. It was an interview ""day"" so a ton of people went. Seventy plus I think.

1:00: I had my interview! It went great. I spent the majority of it talking about my resume, which my interviewer asked me a ton of questions about. He asked me a lot about my projects and whether I preferred Backend or Frontend work, and I was very honest about preferring backend. We got to the last ten minutes of the interview and I figured that I probably wouldn't get a coding question— but I did! He asked me about semaphores, and I was like ""what are those?"", so he suggested I read about them while he set up the coding question environment. I did and pretty quickly identified that it was a type of multi-threading programming, which I told him. He seemed happy with this answer and asked me to implement a few functions of a semaphore class, which I was able to do pretty quick, and was able to use a few functions present in thread classes, which I knew from a few projects I'd done. He asked me a few more questions and then off I went to my second interview.

2:00: My second interview also went super well. My interviewer and I chatted for a bit and hit it off, then we went into a programming question, where I essentially implemented a Hashmap with an array list. There was some context surrounding it, but that was the main thing. It took me a second to think of a solution, but he seemed pleased with what I did come up with. I asked him a ton of questions about his work, then ended the interview.

I agonized about it all day and got an offer about an hour ago! Hopefully this helps some people out :D"
csMajors,Not where I thought I'd end up. What now?,1668549053,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm **very** grateful for my position.

**PREFACE:**

I'm a senior in college and have a very safe offer from an automotive company for a LCOL/MCOL living area with \~105k TC.

I've been interview prepping seriously for about half a year, have made tremendous progress, and can do most LC mediums, (excluding unique topics). Though I am getting rusty because I haven't touched LC in a few weeks.

A lot of my applications were simply too late in regard to when I applied. The positions I wanted most which I thought I applied early for ended up getting frozen or are being processed tremendously slowly and look bleak in likely outcome.

The current offer I have is the only offer on my table and I intend to accept it. I was relatively confident in obtaining a higher salary and working for a more modern tech-based company but things just didn't work out that way this year for me it seems, and I'm ok with that knowing I have much time ahead of me.

**QUESTION:**

My question is, where do I go from here? My start date is June and I'll be moving there entirely alone. **My goal is to basically learn as much as I can at this job and double+ my TC very quickly out of the desire to give my family a better lifestyle and retire my folks.**

Do you guys think I should just do a certain amount of leetcode a week/topic review per week to stay comfortable and slowly get better at LC? Do I just apply to new companies for new grad/SDE 1 positions the moment they may possibly reopen next year (FAANG+)? Is there any unique or general advice you feel I would find helpful?

PS. I've looked up all the things I want to do in the area in regard to fitness and socializing, so I will be touching grass.

PSS. I would post this on cscareerquestions but I don't have the karma. :( 

Thank you in advance, everyone!"

My three interviews all went very well (I thought), and for two of them, the interviewer even told me that this went well, but I still got rejected. 

I do think that the biggest mistake I made was not applying earlier. I only started applying around September because our career counselors required us to get clearance and have our resumes checked before we could start applying. I didn't know how early the cycle started, so I thought I was on time in applying.

I know this has kind of been a rant, but does anyone have suggestions on what to do?"

csMajors,The interview process is so toxic,1668542717,"I'm sick of these recruiters and hiring managers wasting my time talking about how great the position I'm applying for is only to reject me a few days later. Seems like a waste of time from their end, and all it does is make the applicants more disappointed when they get rejected. I just interviewed for a company that spent two hours having their engineers flex their company's software, and the technical question was so easy it seemed like more of a subjective personality test than anything else.

I also hate how they have this pompous attitude about how a technical question will be ""casual"" and ""collaborative"" only to be as vague as possible whenever I ask clarifying questions, acting like robots. Despite all of this, even when I find the most optimal solution while talking to a brick wall of an interviewer, and they tell me I did a great job explaining my thought process, I get rejected anyways. To add insult to injury, they refuse to provide feedback after rejecting me so I'm stuck here not knowing what I can improve on, questioning everything about myself."

And they pay generously although intern pay is less of a concern. I'd probably learn a lot in the startup and it'd be in tech, but ngl unless it's a bigger name I feel like it'd make the new grad recruiting season more difficult. Thoughts? I might be overthinking

My gpa rn is a 3.1 but I hope to get it closer to at least 3.3 before next fall, so it is probably very unlikely that I would be able to get into more prestigious out of state schools but im wondering is it even worth it to apply because of out of state tuition?

I forgot to ask the recruiter how she was doing and just politely went straight into it. Other people who do ask questions are at least giving her a compliment and I was kind of direct.

Hi guys,

I am starting my degree in software engineering in 2023 (a 3-year program), and I have become increasingly interested in the role of a quantitative developer. As such, I have a few questions for current developers about their day-to-day job, as well as questions in relation to the preparation they did to land the role they are in now. Questions are listed below are divided according to these two categories:



Day-to-day

\- Difference being a developer at a prop trading firm vs HFT vs Hedge fund vs Investment bank

\- How varied is your day-to-day challenges? 

\- How much autonomy do you have as a junior?






Preparation 

\- For someone starting a software engineering degree, what would be the best areas to focus on (from reading online it seems like ML is a big emphasis)? I am trying to make a decision as to what I should major in within software engineering 

\- What language would be the best to learn? I have read that C++ is the gold standard in the financial world. 

\- How did you prepare from a finance perspective?

\- Recommendations for resources (courses, books, youtubers). 

\- Recommendations for good projects to do that would sharpen the skillsets you require the most as a quantitative developer

\- How did you divide your time between leetcode problems, projects, courses like algo expert, interview questions, and finance concepts?

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is quite a loaded question but it would be great to get an inside perspective!

Thanks in advance."

Getting to that level takes a certain amount of natural ability and lots of hard work. If you genuinely hate CS, you probably don't have that much natural ability (we generally enjoy the things we are good at). So, to make up that difference you have to work even harder than someone who starts out stronger than you. If you hate CS, you are going to be absolutely miserable trying to do this and more than likely you will fail for this reason. Now, on the other hand if you have a passion for CS don't be discouraged... one of my favorite quotes is, ""the man who loves to walk will walk farther than the man who loves the destination"".

Second, let's suppose you overcome your hate for CS enough to land one of these dream jobs. Dope. You have a good salary. Now you have to work the next 40+ years of your life, working 40 hours a week every week doing something that makes you miserable. Do you really believe that you get a job and all of a sudden CS just magically becomes something you enjoy?

If money is all that you're after, I absolutely promise you there are much easier ways to make more money."

csMajors,Unpopular Opinion - Grinding LC is highly overrated.,1668470141,"Coming from someone who has indeed grinded leetcode, I will say that if you don't manage to get interviews from high tier companies (FAANG+, HFTs, etc.) grinding LC is just a way to feel good about wasting your time. 

And even if you do get these interviews, half the time the difficult part of the interview isn't even LC related, it might be system design, it might be OOP, it might even be something irrelevant to computer science.

Mid/Lower tier companies (anything below FAANG) ask fairly straightforward programming questions. It's almost never harder than the questions on blind 75.

That's not to say that LC isn't useful, I just think it's much smarter to heavily weight your time and effort towards doing interesting projects that help your resume rather than studying LC. Because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much LC you do if you can't even get interviews that require them in the first place."

csMajors,Guide: How to actually get good at leetcode,1668469714,"So I've seen a lot of posts recently asking how to get good at leetcode. I see countless posts from beginners who don't know how to start and panic at not being able to solve easies despite taking a ds&amp;a course. I see posts from those who have done 200+ questions but still can't reliably solve mediums on their own. As someone who recently went through the journey of going from zero DS&amp;A knowledge to interview-ready in 4 months. I figured I'd write a step-by-step guide of what I did to help everyone out. This post is not intended to be a philosophical discussion on whether leetcode is appropriate for interviews, this will be an actionable guide with concrete steps that you can follow.

**Who am I and why you should listen to me:**

I have to preface this guide with my background so you can trust that I know what I'm talking about. I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a Canadian university who self-studied computer science and web development and landed a software engineer role. Part of this self-study process involved learning DS&amp;A and leetcode which took 4 months by studying 3-4 hours a day, 6 days a week. At the start of my journey, I couldn't even solve easies. After these 4 months, I'm now able to consistently (90% of problems) solve mediums in ~20 minutes and hards in ~35 minutes on my own. I also usually solve OAs (tiktok, SIG, IMC, blackrock, pure storage, c3 ai, cisco, tower research) with 100% test cases, and scored 822 on my one codesignal gca attempt (not the best, ran out of time debugging q3 lol). I've done 6 leetcode questions during onsite interviews and have optimally solved all of them. I'm not trying to flex, just trying to show that what I'm saying is credible.

**My overall strategy:**

As a preface, the goal of this guide is to deeply understand the techniques needed to solve LC problems at an abstract level and implement your abstract solution quickly. My approach is based off how technical material is taught in university courses. What they do is teach a strategy/technique at an abstract level, walk through solving guided example problems using that strategy, have students practice through assignments and practice finals, then apply what you've learned on the actual exams. My overall approach to learning is breadth -&gt; depth -&gt; breadth. First learning what you’ll be learning (breadth), learning those specific topics with a full and deep understanding (depth), then tying the specific topics back into the big picture and how they relate to each other (breadth). I also write summary notes after I read through a topic, I find this lets me take all the information and form a generalized abstraction of the topic along with critical specifics, and if I’m able to write a page of well-structured notes using my own understanding of what I just learned then that means I understand the topic deeply. I also re-read these notes at the end of each of the 4 steps for spaced-repetition effects or when I need to jog my memory since re-reading my own written notes takes me back to the mental state I was in when I first wrote them.

**Step 1: Learn Python (or Java or C++):**

The first step is to get familiar with your programming language of choice. I chose Python and recommend you do the same if you have time, but if you’re in a rush then just use whatever you’re familiar with as long as it’s acceptable in coding interviews (Python, Java, C++). Python is the least verbose language and most similar to plain pseudo code, and in a timed test every minute counts. It lets you spend less time on implementation and more time on figuring out the abstract algorithm which is where the bottleneck is for coding interviews. You need to be familiar with a language before you can learn DS&amp;A so you can concurrently learn the language implementations of data structures and algorithms. To learn Python I just went through the W3 Schools’ guide on syntax and overall language specs (dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc.). The official docs are good as well but they have a lot of stuff that you don’t need for coding interviews. I also took notes on the syntax (6 pages). This step took me 10 hours split across 3 days.

**Step 2: Learn DS&amp;A:**

With DS&amp;A you need to learn how each data structure and algorithm works deeply at an abstract level. For me this meant visualizing a gif of the algorithm in my head, learning the time space complexities of operations the DS/A supports and why they are what they are, learning how the DS/A handles edge cases, and writing an implementation in Python. The resource I used was the interactive ebook PythonDS3 by Runestone Academy. It’s full of word explanations, diagrams, and live code in an editor that you can play around with. It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook’s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook’s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn’t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn’t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.

**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**

So here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you’re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that’s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they’re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it’s by far the best resource I’ve found for this step and the time and energy you’ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can’t afford it then I’ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There’s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they’re pretty succinct and don’t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&amp;A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you’ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you’ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it’s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there’s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there’s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you’re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.

**Step 4: Practice**

At this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&amp;A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy’s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don’t look at the solution until you’re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven’t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn’t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you’ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can’t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it’s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think “what was my algorithm doing at this step again?”. Initially, you’ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I’ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it’s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find “easy-to-understand” and ignore the one liners. If I still don’t understand the algorithm I’ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy’s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don’t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.

**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**

Given how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I’m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I’ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I’ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.

And that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps.

csMajors,$170k Technical Sales Salary,1668465271,"Hello everyone,

I have a friend who went to a no-name school for undergrad and also got his MBA from a no-name school. He works at a tech company now making $170k+ doing technical sales (plus commission?). He's only been working a few months and is already making this much. I was looking at his account on LinkedIn and many of his coworkers have similar educational paths. He's also working remotely in a low cost of living area while the position is stationed in a high COL city in California.

I'd personally much prefer to do technical sales since there is a higher degree of personal interaction, and I am extroverted. The main reason I'm grinding leetcode and working in SWE is due to the salary. I would gladly take a minor dip in salary to be doing something like technical sales. I mean $170k is more than a many SWE's make. I did a bit of research on this subreddit but most of the posts are dated.

TLDR: Friend making $170k+ in technical sales after a few months of work.

Is it viable to transition to technical sales and get an MBA? Does anybody know how competitive this field is in terms of salary/positions compared to SWE?

Thanks for reading."

csMajors,"About to go back to school for CS, but I'm having cold feet.",1668442015,"Hey all, for the longest I've been considering switching to a career in computer science, specifically in software engineering. My first exposure to coding was in high school. I had a class where we did some HTML and Java, and I really did well at it and enjoyed it. I haven't really touched it much since, but I have fiddled a bit with FreeCodeCamp and looking up code specifically for an application I use which uses Python. I think so far that it would be a good fit for me, but I'm also afraid.

Concerns: 

My current field is accounting and it's too boring. I just deal with monotonous Excel spreadsheets. I'm not really making anything new happen. I don't feel like I'm contributing to anything.

Maybe this isn't a huge issue since there are workarounds, but I find that sitting down too long in general aggravates my piriformis syndrome. It hurts.

Lastly, I'm in it for the high income potential as well. I know accounting isn't a bad field in this regard over the course of the long-term, but I'm in no way interested in obtaining my CPA and working 50+ hours during busy season.

I'm just having doubts. I don't want to invest in another degree only to find that I face the same problems as I currently am, especially now that I'm in my 30's. 

I am considering attending WGU and think that it'll help with the whole work life balance situation for me. 

I actually already signed up, I'm just getting cold feet I guess. I think knowing how to code and having the ability to fix things is cool. Also having more WFH capabilities too. Plus, I want to provide a better life for my child."

Currently leaning towards Veeva since their core product seems to be software and they have the best  new grad pay. However, I don't know much about them or if they have good reputation for the resume. 
Some details about the other two options:


**Pimco**:
Pros: Pay is substantially better than other offers
Cons: Would not want to work full time, people there seemed boring, I also heard financial industry isn't that great for career? It’s also in Newport Beach which I am not a huge fan of since I’m trans and a bit wary of the culture surrounding the company. (they have a history of discrimination lawsuits 😬😬)


**Walmart**
Pros: Recognizable brand name
Cons: Pay is lowest out of all of them, new grad pays like 20-30k less than Veeva. 


Really just looking to grow my career though, so which would be the better one long term? Would really appreciate any insights anyone has! :)

I don’t necessarily think I am struggling, I understand most of the material (I think) and I wouldn’t really say I don’t enjoy it. It’s always very satisfying when you finally figure something out. However, the assignments cause me immense amounts of anxiety. I start them relatively early and just lose my mind over them because I feel like I am incapable. Next semester I have to take a project based software engineering course I am so worried. I am a determined individual, but lately I’ve been feeling so depressed and like my future is doomed. I regularly check the cs discord for my school and I don’t really think I fit in with anyone and they seem so intelligent. Not saying I don’t believe I am to some degree, but those kids are off the chain. I never have a single clue what they’re talking about. All I know is C (which has been awhile so I kind of forget some of it) Java. I hate to say it but I don’t know if I can carry on with this. I’m sorry to sound so negative, but I have never felt this bad or incapable in my whole life.

Just spent the last 4 hours and went through 3 resumes, since I have to take 45 mins break every hour to play the new Call of Duty (its a medical condition) and also to laugh at the resume details with everyone else in my department (the last resume we threw out, we found the guy's [reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/) through his email and laughed at his posts and comments too)

* Have at least 3-5 years of working experience
* Know all of the obscure details of the C++ compiler
* Be related to one of our VPs (This tip is especially effective, it's how I got my job)

On paper this is a very good position, however, I can't help but have the urge to completely destroy the company by wiping out our codebase, then the database, then the back-ups of everything etc. I've already tested the response time of my colleagues by pushing a small bug to production, it took an hour for someone else on my team to notice, which is more than enough for me to delete every thing and wipe the back-ups. I've already wrote the BASH script to do the former, which I placed on my desktop.

Since I can live at home for a couple years, I’m saving 35-40K post-tax per year in what I would be paying to live by going with Lowe’s over JPM since JPM is hybrid and would require relocation. The base salaries were the same (granted Lowe’s was no state income tax). I don’t regret the choice as it will process my title and responsibilities faster than JPM, but I am worried about being stuck in retail or outside of the tech industry for my career.

(2) how much new grad pay would be (although I'm not too sure about it, LinkedIn seems to be at the top among the 3? I couldn't find much about Waymo.)

csMajors,Having difficulty in intro to structured programming class. Advice appreciated,1668291664,"Won't get too much into details but I am mostly done through this semester but this past month I have no idea what's going on. I was doing fine until our midterm then concept after concept came where I'm clueless and now I just got back a 0 for an assignment which I won't go into too much detail as to why and how devastated I am. Blah blah, self pity over.

My question is this; when you're this far into a semester, what approach should I have to try to catch up or master this class. Should I start from the very beginning or should I try to redo every sample assignment I struggled with? Should I use other resources?

Honestly my biggest challenge here is, as you might guess, problem solving. I thought I was good, but I hit roadblocks so often and the way the class is structured, he tests us for concepts which is great because it really showed me how stupid/bad at solving problems I actually am. This was a huge wake up call for me and Idk, if anyone has tips or has had the issue of being this far in a semester and needing to get their stuff in order, please by all means contact me or share your thoughts here.

csMajors,"Should I be applying to internships this year, or wait until next year?",1668288643,"So technically I am a Sophomore, although I have been at school for three years. I still have two years left. I have taken all my math, physics, and almost all lower division CS classes, I am starting upper division courses next Fall.



Here's why I think I shouldn't apply to internships:



- I am having surgery in July that requires me to stay in the hospital for 1 week and be bed bound for 6 weeks. The internship should have to end before my surgery, and most internships I looked at continue until August 



- I am in a community college. Although I have applied to transfer to a 4-year university to obtain a Bachelorsin Computer Science, which I will be starting next Fall, right now my resume just says I am going for an Associates in Engineering. Most organizations require that I be pursuing a BS in CS, which I am technically not doing right now, although I will be doing next year for sure. So it seems like perhaps I can't apply to most internships?




Here's why I think I should apply:




- If I don't apply this year, that means I will only have one other opportunity to obtain an internship [Junior to Senior year summer]. If I can't get an internship that year, I'm not sure what I should do




What do you guys think? Should I apply to internships?"

csMajors,Should I emphasize on Python or C++ in college?,1668286554,"Hi, in order for me to obtain my associate's I need specialization in one of a variety of languages. I completed one of the Java courses, but despised the instructor &amp; refuse to take any more of his classes.

I'm interested in specialization in either the Python or the C++ route, but which *should* I do? As I understand it, Python has more job demand but learning C++ gives a richer understanding of programming in general. Both routes result in the same number of credit hours, its purely a matter of which one I wanna do.

Long term, I've thought about pursuing web development as a career, but I want to try other CS career options before I cement myself. As I understand it, Python tends to be used for data analytics &amp; AI, whereas C++ tends to be used for large applications like operating systems &amp; web browsers?

csMajors,bleCharacteristic.writeValue() not working from central to peripheral,1668282749,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello everyone I've never posted before so I may not know how a couple of things work but I've made a fairly basic BLE sketch where a central connects consecutively with 2 peripherals, checks the rssi with each of them and then writes a value to the characteristic of the one with the most powerful rssi. My problem is that the bleCharacteristic.writeValue() function is not going through at all and to confirm this I made a while loop at the point where the value should be updated on the peripheral and the program stops there which means that the value is never written in the first place. I have tried to change the value with the BLE app from my phone and it works as it should but it doesn't with the central.

Here's the codes for the central.

Situation: I just got offered a scholarship from Boeing, which would cover tuition and housing for the next two years. However, to receive it, I also have to agree to two summer internships (paid) and a 3 year contract after I graduate. I don't really like Boeing as a company—seems like they've failed a bunch—and I've heard their work environment isn't the best either. But, the financial security would mean I can relax for the next two years and wouldn't have to worry about mass applying to internships again. The letter of intent is coming in on Monday, so I don't have all the details yet (including salary, which would obviously play a big role lol), but this is the general situation.

Should I take it? Would 5 years of Boeing look weird on my resume or would it be a good starting point for when I *really* start my career? Is this much security bad? Any insight would be appreciated"

 I have started learning HTML and CSS. But now I'm questioning my decision of learning web development before DSA. Should I start learning and practicing DSA first or should I give 70% of my time to DSA and 30% to web development?
 
Also, I saw two roadmaps regarding DevOps as I was very confused about what domain to select. Though I came across posts saying that DevOps is not for freshers. I was thinking to learn web dev and DSA first and then start with some Linux fundamentals and then proceed with DevOps. Should I stick to the plan or make changes to it?

It would be kind of you to share your views, suggestions, and guidance.

PS - I'm ready to dedicate three semesters to all of the above-mentioned topics, though I understand completely that learning is a continuous process but the time bound mentioned is important for me as internships start from the third year itself."

I do have prior experience (2 short internships in high school, national service/military in my home country where I also did software dev work, and a summer internship after my freshman year). Apart from that, I also have my favorite projects listed. I do have a full stack web app and a mobile app (none of them were class projects).

Apart from that, my GPA is 3.7/4 and I'm a US citizen.

At this point, I've applied to at least 400 jobs (co-ops for Spring and internships for Summer in 2023). I was hoping to at least interview with some top companies (top tech/FAANG companies) for the practice, but I didn't get an OA/interview from any. I did think I had a fair chance though.

I know I started applying late (September), but I know many other students in school who starting applying around the same time and have received offers from companies like Amazon. I've only had 3 interviews, and I was rejected by 1, and I'm waiting on the other 2.

What could I be doing wrong? I thought of a few things

* My resume isn't good. I have posted it on for feedback on this sub and another, but I didn't really get a lot of feedback on the content. My counselor says it's fine too. I do plan on rewriting it to add more details and to try and quantify what I did, but I'll only get to use it when I am applying again next year
* I'm just super unlucky and the this is a bad time to be applying

I just feel really bad at the moment for not getting a co-op yet because more than half of the semester is already over. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I've applied to pretty much all the software/data/machine learning jobs on my university's career board, and I'm also applying on linkedin and other job boards."

* two weeks pass without any feedback :|
* 10/13 - final round (team matching) invite, scheduled on 10/14
* 10/17 - final round
* another two-ish weeks pass bc the first team didn't want me

To answer the infinite DM's I've received due to my other Citadel post: all of phone screen + virtual onsites were standard LC technical interviews, although one interviewer did ask me a couple questions about C and bit manipulation.

Zendesk and Apple will release results next week, kinda curious what y'all think.

Apple IS&amp;T - Partner Solutions and Technology Team: 

Everything I've read online tells me to stay far away from this organisation. The role seems more business-like than coding. Still, the Apple Brand name is really hard to turn away from and the people seem nice.

Zendesk - Productivity Tooling Team:

Great internship programme by all accounts. The projects seem really interesting. The only issue is the uncertainty from the company being acquired. Probably the highest chance of an internship offer being rescinded.

PayPal - Digital Wallets Team:

I'll likely be working on Backend stuff. However, the TC for full-time is less than Apple and Zendesk in my country. Not sure if they'll do layoffs soon.

Morgan Stanley - Cybersecurity Division: 

Incredible internship programme and great tech culture. From what I'm told, they're planning to send the interns to New York for a week which I'm quite excited for. Still, it's a bank, and it's not exactly a SWE internship. 

I'm looking at full-time TC as well, and it seems that for salary: Zendesk &gt; Apple IS&amp;T &gt; PayPal &gt; MS. 

P.S: If it helps, I'm based in Singapore, so I'll be interning in the Singapore branch for the above companies. Would greatly appreciate any thoughts on these internships

n (type: int): a positive number (at least 2 or more)  This value is the number of people of the opposite gender ""enclosing"" a person p.

We also say that ann is not enclosed by members of the opposite gender, as val, who is of the same gender as ann, sits directly next to her on one of her sides. 

In general, for a person p to be enclosed in the circular table, there must be some members of the opposite gender of p surrounding p on both his/her sides. 

Expected Output:

Test Case 1

get\_persons(\[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M'), ('val', 'F'), ('ann', 'F')\], 2) 

returns \[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M')\]. The tuples in the returned list can be in any order. 

Test Case 2

get\_persons(\[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M'), ('val', 'F'), ('ann', 'F')\], 3) 

returns \[('john', 'M'), ('don', 'M')\].

csMajors,Are you an enterprise developer?,1668182950,"**Are you an enterprise developer?**

We often come across the term “Enterprise Developers” and even more often, we ask ourselves questions about their profile, from basic demographics to purchasing decisions. But who is an Enterprise Developer? According to SlashData, large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with between 1,000 and 5,000 employees and very large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with more than 5,000 employees. Non-enterprise developers are those that remain.

**How many enterprise developers are out there? 🤔**

In Q1 2021, SlashData estimated that there are 1.5M enterprise developers working in large organisations, and 2.0M working in very large enterprises. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a 21% year-on-year growth in the large enterprise population, while the very large enterprise population increased by 18%. 📈

This is impressive growth, considering that the non-enterprise population showed only 10% growth over the same period. However, for the large and very large enterprise population, the immediate picture is one of stability: in the last six months, it has remained practically unchanged.

Considering that the biggest tech companies an important proportion of very large enterprises have benefited from the economic situation caused by the pandemic, it is somewhat of a surprise that the very large enterprise population hasn’t increased.Perhaps there is a backlog of hiring splurges that have yet to show up in the data or these companies are remaining cautious and waiting to see how the pandemic plays out before committing to hiring more employees.

**So are you an enterprise developer?**

Did you see yourself fitting in the data above? Then you probably are an Enterprise Developer. If you want to help the ecosystem grow, please take part in our Cloud Developer Experience Survey. [Start Here](https://survey.developernation.net/name/gcs2?utm_medium=post&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=r/csmajor)

Note: Data comes from the 20th Developer Nation survey (November 2020-February 2021) that reached 19,000+ respondents from 155 countries around the world and was published in SlashData’s [**Who are Enterprise Developers and which Industries they are involved in**](https://slashdata.co/reports/?) report (March, 2021).

csMajors,Is it actually possible for 3rd year students to get into Microsoft Explore? (apparently someone from my uni was able to accomplish this?),1668148745,"On the subreddit for my university, a user claimed to get into the microsoft explore program despite being in 3rd year (another user brought up this fact in an unrelated thread, which is where I spotted this &amp; took a look at what claims were made in this persons profile) and I was wondering if that was even possible since Explore only takes in freshmen &amp; sophomores as far as I am aware.

In a now deleted response this user made the claim that since they were originally in a 5 year specialization of the normal 4 year degree, their LinkedIn showed them as graduating in 2025 (apparently later switched into the 4 year subplan) which prompted a recruiter to message them &amp; get them into the interview process for Explore. After getting the offer they realized something was weird &amp; messaged the recruiter saying that they are actually a 3rd yr &amp; the recruiter was able to waive this off &amp; they got the offer with no hiccups.

The user in question is a real person, so assuming their claimed Explore offer is also real, doesn't that mean in order to maximize your chances, most students regardless of your year should simply push back your listed grad date to whatever Explore needs each year &amp; once you get the offer tell the recruiter to waive the graduation/starting year requirement?"
csMajors,Rejected from internship - quite surprised,1668147812,"Hey all, throwaway for privacy/legal issues. I recently got rejected from a position where I felt that I interviewed very well so I wanted to share/ask some questions.

I'm currently a CS student and was interviewing for a SWE intern position at a pretty big company. I just went through 2 rounds of interviews (after the initial coding screen).

First round they asked 3 questions. 1 Leetcode easy which I solved in &lt;5 minutes (I've seen the question before). 1 Leetcode medium which I got a bit stuck on, but after discussion/explaining my thought process with the engineer, I was able to solve it. The third question was ""just for fun"" (interviewing engineer said usually the 2 questions would take up more time so he's just asking extra questions - this one was more of an open-ended question where I implemented my own class, it sounded like it did everything the interviewer wanted it to do. Left feeling pretty good, but a bit nervous about the trip up on the medium question, but I did end up getting an invite for a 2nd interview.

Second round, they gave me some pre-written code and told me to add some features to it. Everything went pretty well imo, I was able to add every feature that they asked. I even made sure after implementing the feature to run the code and double check with the engineer that it was satisfactory. At no point did I really feel stuck or confused. Again I finished early and the interviewer used that time to ask me about my past experiences. Left this interview feeling super confident.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got an email saying I was rejected. Now, I've been rejected from roles I really want before, so I'm not particularly new to rejections, but for every single one of those, I've left the interview feeling unsure/bad about my performance - usually because I didn't finish or didn't account for all edge cases. But not for this one, I left every interview feeling pretty good, because after all, I solved all their questions, usually this was enough. This one stung a bit more than usual because it was an interview that I felt very very confident about - at no point did the interviewers indicated to me that they were unhappy with my solution or that my solution was wrong or even suboptimal, I was completely under the impression that I did very well. Now perhaps that is on me for being too confident, but to the fact that the interviewer seemed happy with my answer + ending the technical portion early/asking an extra question gave me the feeling that it went well.

My question now is is it worth it to reach out to my interviewer and ask what I did wrong/how I can improve. Another question of mine is that is it possible that my 1st interview was what caused me to get rejected? I was under the impression that if I did poorly on my first interview, they wouldn't schedule a 2nd interview - and the Leetcode med on the first interview was the only question I got semi-stuck on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR: felt that I did really well on both interviews, got rejected, kinda salty because I didn't feel that the feedback the interviewer gave during the interviewer was indicative of the result."

**First Interview - Project Demo (45 mins)**: first, start by talking a bit about yourself; transition into talking about a project you made (and demoing it + code); engineers ask increasingly deep questions about the project; time at the end for questions.

**Second Interview - Technical (60 mins)**: single technical question with several follow-ups; simple ad-hoc with many edge cases. Also time at the end for questions.

**Final Interview - Behavioural (45 mins):** standard behavioural interview, delving deep into past experiences, projects, and passions. Time at the end for questions.

**What do they value?**

They want genuine candidates who adhere to their core values. For me, I heavily emphasized my love of learning and teaching (demonstrated in EdTech project), plus my diverse background (when writing the application). In the first interview, I demoed a project that was somewhat complex but mainly had a high-quality codebase (complete with unit tests, documentation, etc.). I also talked about how it was one of my first projects with the language of choice (again, showing a love of learning).

I have a decent internship for next summer and they give our return offers to 90% of interns but the return offer TC isn't as high as im looking for to be completely honest. I have potrayed myself as a junior to this company and i can graduate Spring 2024 and hypothetically take their return offer but I am leaning towards choosing to graduate in Winter 2024 and hope to get a better internship in summer 2024 and take their return offer or apply to jobs in that season. 

I have heard the return offer for my internship would be around 75k and the median for levels reflects that salary for entry level. 

Should I hypothetically plan to take the return offer, or should i prep for another internship szn?

If i were to graduate in winter 2024, how would i apply to Fulltime jobs in July - November of 2024? Does the season start earlier for winter graduates or do u have to ask employers to move start dates? Any advice from winter grads on how recruiting goes?"

But this year I have negative hope after interviews. 6 interviews so far. 0 offers. I think I’m a pretty realistic guy. Some of those interviews I knew I was getting rejected after. A few of them, I thought I did really well, still rejected.

That’s the thing, everything is just much more competitive. And it sucks to have nothing to show for it after all this work. I really had such high hopes, wanted to work somewhere cool, wanted to meet new people. At this point, I don’t even know what I’ll do."

Both have some pros and cons and I'd like some advice on which to accept. The decision is mainly choosing between a higher TC or having a substantially better work life balance and which company would provide better opportunities for jobs afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

Company 1: Epic Systems

* TC: 110k base + 15k relocation (after 2 years) + 50k stock
* 2 weeks vacation
* Medium cost of living

Pros:

* Big company which can be good for networking
* Active community 
* Training and educational opportunities
* Higher TC

Cons:

* In office
* Would require relocation
* Worse work life balance

&amp;#x200B;

Company 2: Medium sized company

* TC: 86k base + 2k signing bonus + 35k stock
* Low cost of living
* 3.5 weeks vacation
* New office location with about \~30 employees

Pros:

* Hybrid with 2 days wfh
* Relaxed work environment
* More ownership over projects
* Growing company

Cons:

* Lower TC
* Potentially fewer networking opportunities due to smaller office"

Zendesk hasn't released the result yet, but I am curious what people think.

Arista: They seem to be doing well as they have not laid off anyone yet (afaik), and they intend to convert all successful interns to full-time. Internship is on-site. They build software involving network. 4.8 stars review on Glassdoor from previous SWE interns. 

Zendesk: They laid off 5% of employees 3 days ago. Is going through an acquisition right now. Compensation is getting gut left &amp; right and recharge Friday will be no more. Intern conversion rate is unknown. Internship is remote. They build help desk software. 4.0 star reviews on Glassdoor from previous SWE interns.

Compensation isn't important to me.

Which one would you pick given the current market and why?

She very clearly liked me and seemed to be giving me “the look” left right and center. I honestly lost count of the amount of times she laughed at things that I said and she seemed to genuinely enjoy talking to me. We ended up chatting for nearly an hour and a half, and most of our conversation wasn’t even remotely about Google—just random things about ourselves and background. Towards the end of the interview, I had a strange urge to go in for a kiss. It’s as though I completely forgot that this was an interview for Google, and my desires got the best of me. I guess I completely misread the situation too, as she immediately shouted “what are you doing?” as I was about to go in for it. I instantly apologized and we kind of ended things awkwardly then and there. I am really stressed out now about the repercussions of this; I put a lot of work into my Google cover letter and it would really suck if it gets fucked because of this. Am I screwed?

TL;DR: Tried to kiss my Google interviewer at the end of our conversation. I massively fucked up."

This is because I was going for software roles, that I kept failing interviews for and I am going to have to settle for a much much lower comp than what is available out there in my major. I am also a junior so this is my last intern summer. My offer deadlines are approaching, and I don't think I have time to try other routes (I'm still interviewing with one more company for a software role). Overall, I just wanted to share this, please don't call me ungrateful, I'm not, I just want to make the best of my skills."

I love Java and will do my best with questions there, but have a rest API project that uses Python and JSON and I haven't brushed up on them in months. Do they trivia haze you about these things?

I was by myself (IDGAF about eating by myself because I'm not some normie) and this woman started bragging about how much money she made as a realtor last year. A few minutes later, she put down her phone and started glancing at the menu.

Without skipping a beat, I decided to pull my phone out and pretended I was having a conversation. I said how I was sitting next to this realtor who didn't know know her job was going to be replaced by an iPhone app within the decade, and how people could by houses from their smartphones pretty soon. Honestly, I hate people who brag about money. It fucking pisses me off. It made me think about the people in California who struggle to buy houses because of the real estate market. She kinda looked over with a puzzled expression on her face. Her husband came back from the restroom and she explained what happened and he confronted me.

We kinda got into it because I said his wife is more than capable of standing up for herself. He kind of embarassed himself because he was raising his voice while I was stoic and calm. Marcus Aurelius.

Anyways, the next week I had my last rounds of interviews at the Goog. Guess who it was. We went through the interview normally and he gave me the hardest fucking leetcode question. He asked me to program in front of him instead of writing down my solution on the whiteboard and I used the name of the restaurant as one of the temp variables lol. 

Today, they told me I didn't get the position. Gee, I wonder why?

I have reason to believe he didn't hire me because of our previous altercation. Can I hire a lawyer for discrimination? When he saw me, he immediately should have gotten another interviewer because he's inherently biased.

I have a undegrad degree in Engineering of which I used for only 1 year as an electrical engineer, after which I switched career to manufacturing in a non-tech related supplier facing role. I have been getting huge setback in getting internships for summer 2023, which is required for this degree. Every other coursemate around me is at least getting some call backs, even those with less tech experience than me, whether it be in skills or tech work experience.

I know networking is important for someone my age, but I have none. I am so busy trying to catch up with the others in tech skills that I don't have much time to network. I tried to connect with people through Linkedln and such. Again, I feel extremely insecure because of my age and non-experience which is unusual for people of my age. Maybe recruiters just don't know how to put me in a box. I am neither young nor experienced.

What else can I do?  I thought the fact that I got admitted to this Ms program means I might stand a chance to break into tech but I am not sure if the school is just a scam now lol.

JP Morgan offers a pay of $39/hour but   its not remote so I have to pay for housing, although they give me a stipend that covers most of it. Despite the lower pay, I believe JP Morgan is more well known and looks better on a resume for new grad.

They only offer electrical engineering internships, and currently they only have one staffed who is about to graduate. I guess that intern is “more on the programming side” according to him? He said as a CS major it’s not necessarily right up my alley but that they would accept any engineering major. Apparently they could use someone with CS knowledge to help advance their software, or at least to guide them in the right direction, because they don’t do much of that themselves. He also said they may want to build an app in the future. I think I really hit it off with him, and he seemed quite eager for me to apply (it was a very genuine interaction, the company/internship is based in the city I’m from so I think that helped). I have no electrical engineering knowledge and I’m not very deep into CS coursework yet tbh, but if I can get into this position and learn from it then I would love to do that. What do y’all think?"
csMajors,Mathworks Natick vs GS Dallas (Internship),1668101718,"Hi,

I recently received an offer from Mathworks for the EDG internship and had my GS interview yesterday, which went pretty well. The GS recruiter is asking me to ask for a deadline extension for Mathworks as they need some time to get back with the final decision but given the layoffs and everything that is happening, I am worried about getting my offer rescinded due to any delay. What should I do?  
Is GS a better option than Mathworks if I want to aim for Big Tech next year, and for this should get my offer deadline extended or simply accept MathWorks?

Thanks!

i have previously passed the first technical interview two weeks ago, and have an interview scheduled for next week. today the recruiter has reached out to me saying that they are cancelling my interview as they are only considering candidates graduating in 2024 or earlier (i’m graduating in 2025). then the recruiter asked if i’m interested in backend roles with other teams at tiktok, and if so, she will help me with matching with other teams. i said yes and thanked her for her help.

just wondering as this is my first internship hunt, is this a common scenario? and will this likely end up in a rejection if no team is found suitable for me? i’m also worried because it’ll definitely push my second interview even later and i’m not sure if they’re wrapping up hiring soon.

Pros

* The org im placed in doesn't sound interesting (potentially boring intern project?)
* Lower pay (\~$45/hr)

Pros

* Enjoyed from interviewers to recruiter seems really cool

* In SF or NYC

csMajors,Advice for Intro to Java Class,1668043564,"I love coding and I have fun doing it, something that I'm sure EVERYONE has said once they enrolled in their Intro class. 

Regardless, I am falling behind. I'm not confident in myself and my programming. In my class, we have 2 major exams and the final. I got the lowest score in my class on that first exam and going over it with my professor, it was little mistakes that I had no right making. If I had read the questions a bit more carefully, I could have gotten a C or B-. I scored full scores on the coding part, but it was the multiple choice questions that killed me. 

I'm not confident, and I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my class. I don't want to blame it all on the professor, but I had last pickings for my classes, and he has a 2.3 on RateMyProfessor. 

I need advice on how to study/practice for this class. I'm a month away from my final, and about 2-3 weeks away from the 2nd exam. I keep losing motivation. I guess I just need some encouragement. Retaking this class is the LAST thing I want to do, simply because it'd be embarrassing for me. I know that there are SEs out there who got a C in their Intro class, but that isn't enough to calm my nerves. I want to be successful in this class, and in my future with CS. I just don't have a proper support system or confidence.

Step 1: Polish up your resume, make it as specific to the role you like as possible because managers review the resumes of people they'd like on their team, so be as specific as possible.  


Step 2: Stalk the Adobe career page for internships and apply at the earliest date possible.   


Step 3: This is the hardest part. If your resume is selected, you will get an online assessment. It's hackerank. 3 leetcode style questions generally.  


Step 4: If you pass the OA, Your resume is reviewed again, and they perform team matching. You will be invited to the Interview Forum where you can have as much as 4 interviews on the same day. You are essentially being matched with different teams. It can be less than 4. I had just 2 interviews with different teams. They mostly talk about your past experiences and ask you basic CS questions depending on your experience.  


Step 5: You get sent a form to fill specifying the team you liked speaking with the most in order of preference, If the Hiring manager likes you, an offer would be extended.   


Note that at Step 4, you already almost guaranteed an offer, so be confident and be calm.   
Also, Adobe hires on a rolling basis, so you can always re-apply if your initial application is taking a long time.

You can write a comment in your IDE saying what you need as if you were typing it into google like ' create a for loop that iterates through each element of an array' and it will write that code in your IDE with extreme accuracy without having to copy/paste from google. 

Its usually 10$/month but as a student you can use your school email and proof of enrollment to get it for free!!

I wasn't sure how aware the community is/was about this extension but I recently found out and thought I'd share it with you all! At the very least if it is not helpful to you, you might find it cool to play around with. No credit card needed to sign up, all you need is student email address in your github account and proof of enrollment like a college ID with a date on it."

Somehow, I managed to confuse 11am with 11pm (I swear I even double checked), and thought that the interview was at night rather than the morning. Because of that, I completely missed the interview.

I apologized profusely to the recruiter who is coordinating, and although he assured me that accidents do happen and I shouldn't worry about it, I can't help but think this will definitely affect my chances greatly.

For my first SWE Intern interview invitation, I was super shocked and unprepared when I got invited to a phone interview and then a technical interview because I applied and forgot about it. I didn't expect a response. I didn't even remember I applied. Since this was my first technical interview, I completely bombed it.

I've applied to about 40 internships so far, with 10 rejections and waiting for 30 responses. I recently got an invitation to interview for a startup company as a Frontend Software Engineer Intern, quite literally my dream job title. The position is remote and has flexible hours, but it's **unpaid**.

I currently work part-time during school, and working two jobs, where one isn't paid, doesn't sound very fun. I also don't know if my current job would allow me to do the internship. However, this would be *relevant* experience I can put on my resume.

Summer 2023 is far away, so I don't think I should set this internship in stone because I could get another internship that's actually paid. But I'm scared I'll get no offers. Working for free is something I *hate* doing, but I'm afraid if I reject it and I get no offers, I'm screwed.

What's worse is the job posting didn't specify *when* the internship starts and ends. Just that it's unpaid and remote.

coordinates of the lamps on the line, and the effective radius of each of the

lamps' light.

In other words, you are given a two-dimensional array lamps, where

lamps \[1\] contains information about the ith lamp.

●

●

lamps \[1\]\[0\] is an integer representing the lamp's coordinate;

lamps \[1\]\[1\] is a positive integer representing the lamp's effective

radius.

That means that the ith lamp illuminates everything in a range from

lamps \[1\]\[0\] lamps \[1\]\[1\] to lamps\[i\]\[0\] + lamps \[1\]\[1\]

inclusive.

\-

Your task is to find the coordinate of the point that is illuminated by the highest number of lamps. In case of a tie, return the minimum coordinate.

Example

• For lamps = \[\[-2, 3\], \[2, 3\], \[2, 1\]\], the output should be

oneLampLightenedPoints(lamps) = 1.

\[-2,3\] illuminates -5 to 1

\[2,3\] illuminates -1 to 5

He basically said it was his fault in all ways but saying it but said I looked handsome anyway and I could use lip filler to fix it. Kind of ridiculous. 

I would sue but the law protects doctors negligent behavior for stuff like this. Obviously would like to get it fixed but can't just drop school, also finding the right plastic surgeon to fix it is hard. Barely keeping it together with classes, but all I got to do is pass even though I have barely any motivation to do jack shit"

1) Do you say yes or no to the question 'Do you have legal authorization to work in the US'? To be clear, I currently dont hold a work permit in the US and foreign nationals can only apply for one IF they can show a valid job offer. So will the answer be no? Will it hamper my chances if I say no?

csMajors,Stressed and need realistic advice on how to go about transfer application and where to apply,1667975845,"Hi guys,

From SoCal (San Diego).

So basically, I attended CC for a couple years swapped majors a couple times (bio —&gt; jazz performance/MTech) all whilst having zero drive/feeling purposeless and was also going through some rough stuff at the time and that culminated in a really poor gpa. 

I took a gap year and worked a couple jobs while self learning how to code and really fell in love with it. At the tail end of that time period, I decided to meet with a counselor at the CC and create a plan. I decided to start off slow and do well to build my confidence back up and progressively increase difficultly as the semesters have passed. 

Well, It’s been a bit over a year and I wouldn’t even be able to recognize myself from 3 years ago. I’ve had straight A’s, love the material, and have really good relationships with all my profs too. 

So here’s the deal, I can’t stop worrying about competitiveness and I get super stressed and angry with myself because I calculated that even if I get straight A’s till I transfer, I can only climb up to a 3.4 (even with acad. renewal). I even have all my easy GE courses out of the way in addition to some other major specific coursework(the ones I did poorly on (lots of B’s and C’s) so now I’m left with all the tough CS major prep coursework to take simultaneously. 

Currently, it’s not too bad. I’m taking Calc, Java II, and Discrete (expecting 4.0) but worried for next semester. Ok I’m very worried. Im taking Calc II, C++ II, Data Structures, and Physics. Idk if it’s just me who this terrifies but yes I am terrified. The kicker is if I change my schedule or pace financial aide office said I lose my aide so yeah. My next and final semester I’m taking Physics II, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 

I just feel like my stress of trying to get A’s every semester to bring up my GPA is driving me nuts at this point and only see things getting harder just before I can apply. 

I will be finished with coursework by end of fall next year which leaves me spring semester to work on some fun personal projects/ apply for internships or something? Also not sure if they’d make it onto the application if I apply early. 

Is there any way college admissions officers would see the big difference on my transcript between now and before I returned or maybe see my major prep coursework gpa vs GE gpa?? 

Which universities would you guys recommend I apply to given the situation and (fingers-crossed) 3.4 gpa?  (I have researched averages for accepted transfer GPAs into CS in CA but would still like opinions) 

Pls let me know if you guys have any advice, motivation, study tips for the courses I mentioned, really anything. I feel like while I am looking for advice, I’m also kinda venting while I’m stressed out studying for a Discrete midterm. 

Please feel free to comment in a casual way if you don’t feel like providing any constructive info or even vent yourself about your own experiences. Just talking with people would be nice right now. 

Sorry for the super long post by the way…"
csMajors,Oracle OCI - ghosted after verbal offer,1667972773,"So my friend had a verbal offer for an internship at Oracle OCI but her recruiter left the company before she sent over a written offer. Before the recruiter left, she did CC a new recruiter in an email that she sent before she transitioned out of Oracle, but the new recruiter is unresponsive. My friend sent the new recruiter numerous emails over the last three weeks asking about the status of the written offer, but no response. My friend should have received a written offer three weeks ago. Has anyone experienced something like this before from a huge company like Oracle? This is extremely unprofessional.

I’m deciding on whether to accept my offer from Cigna or Emerson, and I’m also currently in the interview process with Dick’s Sporting Goods (Not sure where that’s going, hopeful tho). 

The pay is roughly the same, and this’d be my first internship. All companies give me the flexibility to work within my location, and I liked everyone I’ve talked to at these companies so far. I’m having a hard time deciding, and if DSG were to extend an offer, it’d make me even more uncertain. 

I was wondering if anyone has had any summer internship experience with any of these respective companies. If yes, could you share your experience?"

I know people are going to say just practice more, and that probably is the answer I know but don’t want to hear, but I feel like for the time I’m putting in I’m not reaping the reward. Should I switch majors or stick it out? I’ve always been able to learn quickly and been a bit more advanced than my peers so it suddenly feels like a train hit me and I’m way behind everyone.

Now for the majority of this post…

Advice:

to start this off I should probably note that I didn’t have any technical experience coming into college, I was actually gonna major in something like econ or psychology idk. When I decided to make the switch to CS, I was that one dweeb in all my classes who literally felt behind in everything. So you may ask how did I make the progress to where I am now?

the answer to this question is very simple: Leetcode, Leetcode, Leetcode

Let me repeat that again: Leetcode,Leetcode, Leetcode. 


that’s it, simple. keep your head down and focus on leetcode, and it will 99% guarentee you success. now the salty ones will complain and state that because I go to a T10 CS school, I just had an automatic advantage. Idk how else to debunk this other than the fact that my resume in freshman/sophomore year was absolute dog shit. every recruiter I talked to back then advised that I apply for more “business centered roles”. I ignored all of them and just grinded leetcode. the one company that gave me a chance with just an interview was my golden ticket. I knocked all the rounds out of the park because of LEETCODE. I kept my head down and grinded that shit hard until I was given a chance. 

I would say after getting the first internship on the resume it helped a shit ton. from there it became pretty easy to atleast get an interview. my advice for those struggling to get any opportunities right now would be to just put your head down and grind leetcode, that’s it. when this stupid recession is “over”, focus then heavily on the networking and applying. (Note: obviously still apply to jobs now, but make sure to focus on leetcode more imo). to be best prepared after the recession is over, I would want to be a leetcode god. 

that’s it. good luck everyone 👋 

NOTE: obviously it’s easier for U.S. citizens to get a job and ik that :). for the international students here I hope y’all atleast find something."

It's been a few days and I haven't got a reply from the contact. I have other offer deadlines that are coming up. My recruiter was aware of these deadlines.

Out of the four current classes i'm taking, I only need to pass two for the computer science minor. I was thinking because i'm a little behind in all of my current classes, I should just focus on the two classes I actually need for the minor and put the other two classes on the side, but I don't know if that would be the best idea because:

1. I don't know if potentially having two F's on my transcript would give on the best representation for any future endeavors of mine. 
2. I have to get a GPA of 2.5 in order to be accepted as a business major.

Now, my plan is to just grind out all of my classes next semester and just aim for A's and B's since I now sort of know what it takes to be a successful college student, but I still don't know if I should go with the plan mentioned above. If you could offer me any advice, please do so in the comments or DM. Thank you!"

But just within the team I worked with they thought I could start onboarding a little earlier, and gave me the stuff to look into/presentation tasks starting late June, so on my resume, I put my internship date as June - August.

With a part time internship, school work, LeetCode, personal projects, and internship applications it is fair to say I essentially have existed to do nothing but pursue my career for the past few months and I feel like I will reach a breaking point sooner or later. I hardly take part in hobbies, socialize, or do much else besides work towards a better job.

It also doesn't help that I decided to go to community college first so I feel like so much of my effort is passed to the side just from a glance at my resume and not seeing a B.S. degree.

On the flip side I guess I should be happy that worst case scenario I will have the ability to return to my IT internship this coming Summer if I get literally zero offers, but I just feel like I'll be so defeated and sad if I put all this work in and getting nothing out.

I thought I was in good path, so I decided to apply. I applied on August 18. Two months passed and I didn't received an update. Then I attended to an explore internship info session, there the recruiter said that if we dont hear back in 3 months that we should write to support. It was almost 2 weeks left to the 3 months I've been waiting.

Today I oppened the career action center again to see if there were updates. I didn't see the aplication in the submitted section.

csMajors,Going from Quant Trader to SWE,1667948351,"I'm a CS Major in my third year and was lucky enough to get a quant trader internship for this summer at a great firm. I have some other offers for SW engineering that I really like, though a bit less prestigious/high-paying than the trader offer (not a big deal to me, just another factor). While I'm generally interested in a trader position, I know for sure that I like CS a lot and think it's very possible I decide to do something in this field at some point in my life. If I do a trading internship this summer, will I be able easily transition back to a career in software if I realize that it's a better fit for me."

So now I'm wondering, how necessary is leetcode? Should I be working on some problems on my free time? Or is doing side projects more important? How many leetcode problems should I do? Is it necessary only for FAANG internships [which I'm not interested in] or for all internships? Should I create an account? Is it important that my account have my real name?

csMajors,Stripe vs Salesforce,1667938821,"I'm currently deciding between Stripe and Salesforce SWE internships. I'm a 3rd year right now, but I plan on rerecruiting for a full time just because I'm not necessarily that interested in what either of these companies are doing. Given this year's job market, I think I might have to just go with one of these companies instead of waiting for a company I'm more interested to get back to me. My dream companies would be something along the lines of Snapchat, Spotify, Pinterest, etc (more user facing companies if that makes sense?). Here are the pros and cons of each internship from my perspective, and I would love to hear what anyone else has to say about this.

After housing and benefits are added up, both internships pay just about the same, so that's not the biggest deal to me. 

**Stripe**

Pros: 

* Seems to be a bit more of a prestigious internship so it might add more value to my resume? Correct me if I'm wrong
* Company provides food and more benefits
* Work is more engaging and interesting

Cons:

* Low possibility of a return offer (I heard barely anyone from last year's Stripe intern class got return offers) and considering all the new layoffs, I definitely don't know what the situation will be like this year
* Bad work-life balance, which is something that is very important to me but as long as I'm not working over the typical 9-5, I think I would be okay with it

**Salesforce**

Pros:

* Great work life balance and employees love the company
* More stability that Stripe, much higher chance of a return offer

Cons:

* Adds less value to my resume? Please correct me if I'm wrong
* The work I do is more boring and obselete, at least that's what people tell me. I think this is to be somewhat expected when you work at a large tech company though"

csMajors,My Microsoft interview experience,1667932598,"I’ve been getting ALOT of dm’s about my experience interviewing for TPM so I’m making a post so everyone can have their questions answered in one place. 

I had no coding questions but I heard that some people did. Honestly it was good. My interviewers were friendly. Most of the time was focused on purely behavioral/ hypothetical questions but it’s not that simple. For instance, I own a small business. One of my behavioral q’s was “tell me about a time you were able to simplify a process” so I talked about how I created a subscription model to eliminate a checkout process for my customers. They dug into that with follow up questions like “How did you land on a subscription model? Did you try out other things first? How did you manage the timeline of rolling out the subscription model? Did you end up prioritizing/deprioritizing certain products/initiatives? if so, how did you decide what to prioritize/deprioritize.. Okay lets walk through a hypothetical. Imagine you’re a PM and there is a problem that can be solved with a specific software. You have two options, buy the software from a 3rd party company or develop the software internally. What would you choose for a short term solution and why? what would you choose for a medium term solution and why? How would you pitch that solution to leadership? What are the 3 most important factors when considering going with a certain solution? (My answer was time, cost, and impact) Everything is structured like a fluid conversation. Resume review questions /behavioral questions end up blending together most of the time. I had 2 product design questions in the last interview of the loop but it wasn’t your typical “design a clock for a blind person”. On one of them I didnt even realize it was a product design question until part way through. They asked me my favorite microsoft product and after I answered, they asked a bunch of follow up questions that mirror those in product design questions and thats when I realized lol so I immediately pivoted and started using a product design framework. I hope this was detailed enough for you all."

csMajors,Not getting a job,1667909150,"Hey everyone - 

So long story short, I'm a computer science master's student with working experience. After my undergrad, I did a IT Rotational Program where they barely let me touch code. I did a bit of frontend programming and some bash. Now, my full-time role is a scrum master and I hate it. Not going to get in all the details of why, but I'd rather be hands-on. 

When I apply for the new grad SWE roles, I'm usually told they do not take master's students or that they will not take me because I did not do my master's straight after undergrad. 

Then I was told to apply for associate roles, which has been a nightmare of it's own, because I'm competing with people who probably have years of software development experience. 

Now, I'm being told to just work as a scrum master in another company by family/friends, but.. it's just not for me. Any tips on how I can get into a software development role?"

I'm completely lost in this level 600 course, and I find the class that's in C to be challenging as well, almost overwhelming. I'm thinking that I should try to do a bachelor's instead. It would take the same amount of time to do that as the master's. I think I prefer that option because I find this current program to be demoralizing."

csMajors,CS Junior: Are Python projects worth the effort?,1667892002,"I am a Junior and I graduate sometime next year (Online school so rolling schedule) I'm in the Army and I'm deployed right now so I have free time. I am obviously focusing on class work, and I'm also doing LeetCode with Python to keep my coding skills going. As of right now, I am getting better at LeetCode using Python and I'm getting to the point where I can solve Mediums on my own without immediately looking up a solution.

My question is it worth it to make projects using Python? I don't know what type of development I want to do professionally. TBH I find them all equally interesting. I've applied for a few jobs but all they ask for is LeetCode questions. I've never had a single question about a project I've made. Are projects even worth the effort? Or should I just stick to LeetCode?

Also for projects should I work on learning Django and make a web dev project? Or something else entirely? There doesn't seem to be any kind of consensus on what companies actually want to see out of it."

My profile/resume: I’m a CIS major at a no-name state school. I own a small business and had a sophomore year internship as a technology consulting intern at a well known firm working under a product owner and a tpm. 

The interviews:
Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: Did assessment and hirevue. Hirevue was all behavioral and product sense. Ghosted. 

Jane Street Business Dev: I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for a Business Dev analyst. I completed the take-home but I withdrew after the resume screen because I wasn’t interested in the role. I have no information on final interviews.

Palantir Deployment Strategist: I withdrew after the phone round due to me deciding the role wasnt for me after some research. I also was turned off by the length of their recruitment process. I have no information on final interviews.

Manstercard PM: Their final interviews were mostly behavioral with a few technical questions about the agile software dev process. There was no coding. They dug into my resume. The interviewers were dull and the pay was abysmal. I declined their offer. 

Oracle PM: this one was weird. I applied for Pm but the recruiter tried to push me through to interviews for a security engineer. I have zero experience in cybersecurity so I asked to be placed back on the Pm track and she agreed. The phone screen seemed rushed. It was ALL behavioral. I was ghosted after phone screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Expedia PM: I completed the assessment and Hirvue. Hirevue was behavioral and product sense questions. Final interview was behavioral and technical questions (no coding) and a mini case study that was basically a product design question. I got an offer. I’m declining it.

Walmart PM: I completed a personality assessment and passed. Final interviews were behavioral and product sense/design. No coding. I’m declining the offer.

“That” FAANG Business Intelligence Engineer: Final interviews were half behavioral half technical. Hit hard on your LP’s. They also asked easy/medium SQL questions and basic statistics questions. I was rejected after final round.

“That” FAANG again Program Manager: All behavioral and resume review. Like intense resume review. Again hit hard on LP’s. I got an offer. I’m declining.

Google APM: Rejected after resume screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Google Bold: Received candidate questionnaire but haven’t heard from them since. I have no information on final interviews. 

Microsoft Customer Success: All behavioral and Analytical questions with an intense resume review. This is a customer facing role so much sure all of your answers are customer focused. I declined the offer.

Microsoft TPM: Mostly behavioral and resume review with some analytical and product design/ product sense questions. Use exponent/ cracking the PM to prepare. I’m accepting this offer."

1. **Work simulation:** \~45 minutes. You'll work through scenarios like those commonly experienced by \*\*\*\*\*\* Support Engineers.
2. **Technical Knowledge**: \~ 25 minutes. You’ll answer a series of questions to help us understand your technical knowledge.
3. **Work preferences &amp; skills**: \~ 10 minutes. You'll answer questions to give us a better sense of your work preferences and technical proficiency.

I'm really nervous to take it as it's 80 minutes(which I'm not complaining) as it seems like their might be a lot of questions! I just want to be as prepared as possible for something like this !

With all the layoffs from big tech and market corrections to tech making it so that VC is harder to come by, it caused less open positions than last year (I think, corrct me if I am wrong). I was hoping this tech recession would be done by the time I graduate, but I'm seeing some of you say that it's gonna last 5+ years before it gets better. Some of you are acting like getting a internship let alone a job is a herculean effort only achievable by the beat and brightest.

Am I fucked? The competition has been increasing a lot in recent years, and the number of CS grads has only risen dramatically. I know the demand for skilled engineers is still much higher than supply, but the market for juniors is abysmal I heard, at least for big tech. If it's also abysmal for regular ass joe companies according to this sub then god help me. People are saying that tech is still the best field to get into, although I am starting to have doubts about that. 

If this is better than other white collar fields, then those fields are swimming in the pits of hell. Is there anything else marketable I should learn besides the obvious like having good social skills? What should I do to prepare?"

I'm a junior and pretty ahead of my class schedule so I have lots of time to spare. Of course, My major GPA would probably not change, and my transcript would show the whole story.

csMajors,Finding Unicorns to Apply To (Internships/New Grad),1667856865,"Hi everyone,

Clearly lots of companies are sinking right now, especially with big tech. Things are pretty unfortunate, especially for people who've interned at top companies and were looking for return offers.

Lots of people, even those with tons of top-tier internships, are having trouble landing jobs because so few large firms are hiring.

I was doing some research into Unicorns (private companies worth over $1 Billion), and I realized that lots of Unicorns that we talk about on this Subreddit (Databricks, Stripe, Scale AI), are pretty well known and competitive, but I saw that there were a ton more Unicorns that people just haven't heard of, but have valuations just as high.

I thought that this was a simple thing to build, so I scraped some data and built a simple website to help people find a list of Unicorns given the area that they're interested in.

It turns out that there's companies like Miro, GoodLeap, and Talkdesk, all of which are Software Unicorns with valuations of at least $10 Billion.

Here's a link to the site, in case you're curious: [https://www.unicornsearch.org/](https://www.unicornsearch.org/)

Please let me know if you find the website useful for finding more companies to apply to."

csMajors,Okta Intern,1667856780,"Hello! Looking for some opinions on this. I have a FAANG Vancouver intern offer and an Okta Toronto intern offer. TC is exactly the same. Thinking more about which one would lead to better full-time opportunities, either in terms of looking better on the resume or likelihood of getting a return offer. Would love to just return to where I intern and not have to go through recruiting all over again next year.

Okta pros:

* In Toronto, way closer to home. Don't mind relocating for the summer but would want return offers in Toronto. My other offer is in Vancouver, and I'm worried return offers would be in Vancouver too.
* Seems to have a good culture (at least better than the alternative)
* Way longer and more professional 4-round interview process. Whereas the other offer had one round after OA, interviewer didn't show up first time, and very robotic communications.
* Hires a small handful of interns each year compared to the other company's 10,000+ (but obviously is much smaller). Might look more impressive on the resume for recruiters who know.

Okta cons:

* FAANG - good brand name, whereas many people haven't heard of Okta.
* Alternative has more products and opportunities than Okta, which has only a handful of niche product offerings

Anyone interned at Okta and can speak to their experience? Any opinions? Thanks!"

I'm trying to prep as my interview is in Dec. However, since my program doesn't offer DS&amp;A (we have coding, python/java, JavaScript, and front end), I'm left to YouTube uni and online sources to learn. For the past 3 days now, I simply review over python syntax language to refresh myself back into the language. I made a doc of videos and book topics to cover.  I also planned on going to tutoring lessons to review what I learned in DSA lecture, (I finished Jovian's DSA in Python videos on YouTube, now going to Neetcode's videos), however the CS tutor was rude and chastised me the entire session.

  
I need to make sure I get this internship (or anything, prob SWE, since PM is more difficult) for this summer as I am graduating 23'.

*Note: I am also in a 5year program, &amp; currently, my extra one-year master's program is up in the air (applying for more scholarships, finding part-time jobs that offer tuition remission, etc.).*  Anyways, I have a date confirmed. However, I am getting a little overwhelmed as it's a long interview session. 

So here's what I wrote in my docs:

Neetcode's videos of the Blind 75.

Blind 75: And all the topics within each topic. 

Cracking the Coding Interview book (also within the blind 75 topics)

Common sense guide to DS&amp;A 

Jovains' DSA in Python (completed)

Again, since I watched an entire lecture, I plan to skim through the Common sense guide to DS&amp;A to get a further understanding while going through a couple of Neetcode's Blind 75 videos.

And about the technical algorithm interview what do you feel is the difficulty level? Like medium questions on Leetcode? I read somewhere that they tend to ask concurrency questions, is it still the case in your experience?

Affirmative Action is a contentious issue. At the university level, there are valid arguments to be made. But as far as hiring practices in Big Tech, I don’t get how anyone has an issues. 

As far as I know, there are special programs to get women in minorities into tech. Sometimes there’s diversity and inclusion internships which were made for minorities only. Résumés from minorities probably go straight to the top of the pile. 

But I have no issue with any of these. Anyone that pretend sexism and racism isn’t an issue in tech opportunities and in the workplace/school is an idiot. These hardly makeup for the disadvantage that is discrimination. 

Plus, the hardest part of breaking into tech isn’t getting the interview, it’s passing the interview. This year has been an anomaly, with the economy and all the hiring freezes. But typically, and this is especially true after the entry level, it’s not really that hard to just get an interview. I’ve seen no evidence that minorities are given an easier time during the actual interview.

My background/ resume: I’m a CIS major (junior)  at a no name state school. I have a 3.5 GPA. I transferred from a community college to my state school this fall. I own a small business. I was lucky enough to land a sophomore internship with EY as a technology consultant intern while I was still at community college. I worked under a PM while I was there and used that work experience on my resume to target PM internships this year. I also have some classes I took on my resume (Computer hardware and software architecture, database design and development, communication systems, systems design and analysis etc). I also have a research project on my resume from a class i took at my cc on Human Sexuality. It was a risk putting it on my resume but I thought it might be an interesting talking point and I was right. My interviewers asked me about it alot. 

My interviews: First I would like to say that I’m not a strong coder. I know a bit of python and SQL but that’s it. I don’t know DS&amp;A and I’ve never done a LC question in a language outside of SQL in my life. I also had a return offer from EY.

Palantir Deployment Strategist:  I went through the phone screen and it was ALL behavioral. I withdrew from the process after I figured out more about the role and how LONG their interview process is. I didnt do final interviews.

Jane Street Business Development Analyst: I did the take home assignment (Excel) but I withdrew from the process after phone screen because I honestly wasn’t interested in the role. I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for business dev.

Mastercard PM: The interviews were all behavioral and technical questions (no coding)They grilled me on my resume with an extra focus at my time at EY under the PM. I declined their offer because honestly, their interviewers were very dull and they didnt even seem excited to be working there. Also, the work wasn’t interesting and they pay was LOW. I had a return offer from EY paying more so.

Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: I did the hirevue and assessment but I was ghosted after that. 

Walmart PM: I did a personality assessment and final interviews were Behavioral/ product sense/ design. one question was directly off glassdoor. I declined their offer because I ended up getting the offer I wanted. 

Oracle PM: It was weird, I applied for PM but they wanted to move me forward for a security engineer role even though I have absolutely nothing on my resume related to cyber security. I told the interviewer/recruiter that I wasn’t interested in that role and she agreed to move me back over to PM. I did a phone screen that was rushed. Honestly the interviewer didnt seem to be listening to be at all lol. It was all behavioral. I got ghosted after the phone screen. 

‘That’ FAANG company Program Manager: This isnt a PM role and I knew that. It was all behavioral. Really hit hard on your LP’s because they will grill you on them with follow up questions. They really dig into your resume.  I got an offer but I’m declining it because I got an offer for the role I want. 

‘That’ FAANG company (again) Business Intelligence Engineer: The interviews were half behavioral, half technical. Again, study LP’s. I was also asked Easy/Medium SQL leetcode questions and basic questions about statistics (standard deviations etc). I was rejected after final rounds. 

Expedia PM: I completed an assessment and a Hirevue asking product sense questions. Final interviews were a mix of behavioral/technical (no coding)/ and a case study that was honestly a product design question. They grilled me on my resume. I got an offer. I’m declining it. 

Google Bold: I got the questionnaire but I haven’t heard from them since I submitted it. I’m exhausted after these past few months anyway so I’m withdrawing from the process. 

Google APM: I was rejected after resume screen.

Microsoft Customer Success AND TPM: I’m bunching these together because I went through the process for both of these roles at the same time. Microsoft is SLOWWWW so these processes took months. For customer success, Both the first and final round interviews were ALL behavioral and analytical questions. They are looking for someone who is customer obsessed because the role is customer facing/ post-sales. I got an offer but I declined it because I wanted TPM
For TPM- Mainly behavioral but they do ask alot of analytical, hypothetical, and product sense/design questions. They grilled me on my resume HARD. They care more about your thought process in product design questions than they do about your solution. They want to make sure you can handle ambiguity. I got an offer for TPM. that is the one I’m accepting. 

I know this was long. But maybe it can help someone who’s prepping for interviews. I used cracking the PM book, exponent website/ youtube videos to prepare for my interviews. Anything more than that is overkill. These past few months have been exhausting and I’m happy to be finished with recruitment season."

Expedia PM: I completed an assessment and a Hirevue asking product sense questions. Final interviews were a mix of behavioral/technical (no coding)/ and a case study that was honestly a product design question. They grilled me on my resume. I got an offer. I’m declining it. 

Google Bold: I got the questionnaire but I haven’t heard from them since I submitted it. I’m exhausted after these past few months anyway so I’m withdrawing from the process. 

Google APM: I was rejected after resume screen.

Microsoft Customer Success AND TPM: I’m bunching these together because I went through the process for both of these roles at the same time. Microsoft is SLOWWWW so these processes took months. For customer success, Both the first and final round interviews were ALL behavioral and analytical questions. They are looking for someone who is customer obsessed because the role is customer facing/ post-sales. I got an offer but I declined it because I wanted TPM
For TPM- Mainly behavioral but they do ask alot of analytical, hypothetical, and product sense/design questions. They grilled me on my resume HARD. They care more about your thought process in product design questions than they do about your solution. They want to make sure you can handle ambiguity. I got an offer for TPM. that is the one I’m accepting. 

I know this was long. But maybe it can help someone who’s prepping for interviews. I used cracking the PM book, exponent website/ youtube videos to prepare for my interviews. Anything more than that is overkill. These past few months have been exhausting and I’m happy to be finished with recruitment season."

Can't even run android studio. If I power off, it takes like 20 minutes to get ready when powered on. And altogether just not great.

As I'm currently in final year of University, I'm thinking I definitely need an upgrade to take on serious personal project that can give me a chance at landing good jobs. So I'd like some recommendations.

Note: No Macs yet (just not ready for the Apple lifestyle). I know this is the time of the year when deals start coming up so I'm hoping to get a steal between $600- $1000 as budget is limited.

Salesforce:

Pros:

* SF seems fun
* Large intern groups
* Good WLB
* High return offer rate
* Already know my team and the manager &amp; developer in my team are extremely nice

Cons:

* Not sure if I am really interested in working on the team's product, but the manager said I could work combine what I am interested in with their products
* According to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), Salesforce has lower TC (new grad) than Bloomberg

Bloomberg:

Pros:

* Interning at NYC will be so much fun
* Corporate Housing
* Good WLB
* Also high return offer rate?
* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on, but according to the recruiter there will be a team matching process and they will try to match me to a team that aligns with my interests
* Higher TC according to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)

Cons:

* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on
* Might be harder to get a Salesforce new grad offer than a Bloomberg new grad offer so I might still get the offer from Bloomberg if I try again next year?

Hi, I'm 16, and I'm in 11th grade. I've made a solid decision ever since I was 14(9th grade) that I'd do CS as a major, and that decision still hasn't changed. I love the whole concept of programming, but I dont really like math. Or rather, how my teacher teaches it. What should I expect from the first year of CS? Also, will I need full mastery of py? I've been slacking of big time, and I mean BIG TIME on programming. I barely even go on vscode anymore, but that's because theres no sort of deadline or consequence. I love programming, but I can't get myself to actually start my lines of code.

So yeah, what should I expect from cs, and what math topics do they do? Is CS just 90% math and 10% programming? Or is there a lot of programming involved?"

csMajors,CS degree takes all my free time.,1667720433,"TL:DR
CS degree takes all my free time and I cant study actually important coding skills.

Im in my second year of CS and I have started to look for internship options. Almost every place requires something I am not familiar with (Node.js, Spring, Angular...).

I really like programming and would like to learn these technologies, but I have to spend almost all my free time studying for classes unrelated to coding. 

Im not saying that I did not learn usefull things, I had classes where we studied (Java, CSS, HTML, Python, architechtures, DBs, algorithms..), but almost half of my classes are math related.

For example, instead of learning what I want and find useful for applying for a job or making projects, I spend almost all my free time studying statistics, probability and mathematical analysis.

Is this normal?
Im I doing the right thing or should I change?"

csMajors,I have a friend who hasn’t done a single LC problem and has gotten multiple internship offers,1667713119,"I have to wonder if this sub has rotted my brain or if she’s actually just crazy good. 


But basically, exactly what the title says. She applied in bulk in September and received multiple interviews (for full transparency, I would say 4-5 of those were through/at Grace Hopper). She’s a sophomore. During this time I was stressing out doing leetcode problems and not applying - I’m a junior who switched into CS fairly late. 

She received a total of 5 offers, and the top contenders were a very reputable tech company and a very solid bank. In comparison, I have had a few interviews lined up along with a couple tens of rejections. 

I would ask her after each interview how it went and generally she would say it was okay. I remember telling her how I couldn’t grasp DP problems and she didn’t even know what DP was 😭 Her hardest interview was Jane Street where they asked about trees. 

I would say we’re on par in terms of skill and knowledge. We’re really close haha despite how this post may sound but I don’t like to pry, especially with how stressful this process has been for me. But ya, I’ve seen firsthand her coding abilities and she’s just a normal, competent student. So I’m not sure if she’s gotten extremely lucky, I’m the most unfortunate mf ever, or if the LC grind is just overhyped. 

A theory I have is that she’s just a really good communicator. With the few interviews I’ve had, I’ve been rejected at the behavioral stage ://

Regardless, just something on my mind! And absolutely not shitting on her, just interesting to see everything pan out. Things do work out, though I guess anecdotally."

csMajors,Which internship to choose for next summer? Seeking honest input.,1667712713,"Sophomore rn, spent last summer at Nvidia doing Ignite. Had a lot of fun, even though it was remote. Learnt a lot and wondering whether I should go back or try something new?

Interests:

Infra/Devops and recently ML Eng(infra specifically)

All pay about the same/ Internship TC doesn't really matter to me,

Also did final rounds with Amazon(which I think went pretty well, solved the LC and aced the LPs) and in the process with Hashicorp(which I like and confident will work out).

M pros:

They really care about their interns + nice perks.

Decent resume value?

Almost guaranteed return offer next summer(so long as I do my shit obviously haha)

M cons:

in Seattle(would rather be in nyc/east coast)

Not sure what team I'll be on --&gt; crapshoot.

STEP pros: 

Good pipeline(no need to reinterview afaik) to  swe intern  which would be ..nice next summer.

Good resume value?

cons:

in MTV(boring asf location, hoping I can change locations to nyc)

a sophomore program

only gives about 6k pre-tax housing which sounds like a nightmare to find in mtv

Bloomberg pros:

in nyc + corp housing which is pretty nice.

I'd be working with their cloud infra(interesting tech stack)

Good pipeline to quant shops swe(?) - someone pls correct me if I'm wrong. my goal is 2S next summer. 

Cons:

hmm, not a pure tech co?

not as much resume value?

Nvidia pros:

Loved the company and team, i'd be in a different team tho.

new team is exactly what I'm interested in and pretty high impact( building ML Infra for computer vision)

Could either go remote(pro) or be in Santa Clara(con)

cons:

considering trying something new

Santa Clara would be less than ideal

Not the most exciting tech stack

I'm a sophomore, so not really worrying too much about return offers. Not sure what I want to do in the future: really conflicted about whether I should try and go into SWE @ trading firms or regular SWE at tech companies.

Akuna Python Dev (Chicago) Pros: Quant, more selective, know I'm definitely in a Python team. Cons: probably worse WLB, worse name brand (is this true??), Python might not be that useful (?), kinda got lowballed (does this mean they don't really care about me and won't give me good work?).

Amazon SDE Intern (Seattle): Pros: Amazon is a big tech company/FAANG+, probably better name brand recognition, better WLB, *infinite* free bananas. Cons: team matching is fucked, work might not be that impactful/interesting.

csMajors,From 0 to quant shops,1667705239,"Writing this post as part-appreciation, part-advisory, part-self-validation. Like many others, I wrote my first line of code in my freshman year. Grew up in a one-income family, only ever been through shitty public schooling, no competitive math background, public uni. Now after 4 semesters, I have various offers most notably from JS, Akuna, Cit/Citsec, and HRT; likely signing HRT over the rest. Wouldn't say I deserve them 100%, but still gonna try to share some insight.

This subreddit is an insane motivator. As a long-time lurker, the usual self-congratulatory post (kinda like this 1) left me happy for my peers but also feeling so inadequate. Every step of the way up, I was never complacent because of this subreddit. Ego and pride can do crazy things for your overall motivation, so for that I'm grateful.

The single most important thing that's helped me through the years is recognizing that recruitment is largely not a meritocracy. The difference between someone who got an offer vs. someone who didn't could be chalked up to having nicer interviewers or easier questions. So many small things that are out of your control can significantly impact your odds (e.g. signing up for an interview on Tuesday instead of Wednesday so you get a shitty, power-tripping interviewer). This is how I was able to convince myself that I'm able to achieve these things in the face of rejection, and dodge all feelings of impostor syndrome. With that being said though, you can lower your variance in interview performance as a result of these outside factors with solid prep, naturally.

My advice focuses primarily on engineering in a quant firm context. The hardest part about all of this is knowing where to focus your time. Everybody has a life outside of school/recruitment, so ensuring that the time you spend with your head in the books is spent optimally is so so important. It's a good feeling and super motivating when you know the things you are doing \*will\* secure future gains (like going to the gym), and not going to waste.

1. Learn C++ ASAP. Python just feels nice and I used it as a crutch for so long, but I can attribute most of my successes to making the switch. The level of complexity on problems as you move up are just more efficiently tackled with C++'s robust STL. For instance, keeping pointers to nodes in a BST would require your own class implementation in Python, but C++ has this baked in. Also, some companies require you to interview in C++, (e.g. HRT, Akuna). A good way to get practice is to just start doing LC or building projects w/ cpp. Start coding by guessing bits of syntax, and correct them as you go along until it becomes natural.

2. Ditch web development. Wasted a solid 6 months on this. One of the biggest misconceptions I had starting out was that most engineers focus exclusively on web development, and that getting a solid footing in web dev would do me wonders for my job prospects. Unless you genuinely have a passion for it and it makes you happy, don't bother with it. I want to say this advice is applicable to big-tech roles too.

3. Learn some basic finance. If you can demonstrate that you understand what different classifications of securities are, basic trading strategy, surface-level understanding of options theory, and show that you're ""genuinely"" interested in finance, it goes a long way to leave a better impression on your interviewers prior to starting your coding questions. Building a rapport before the technical part starts is so important for mental. For both you and your interviewer. People are always biased towards more charismatic candidates, whether they're aware of it or not. (There have been some interviews where I've shit the bed, but moved on anyway -- I want to attribute this to maintaining a good relationship with my interviewer). It's surprising to know how many people fail hiring manager rounds bc they couldn't explain why they wanted to make the switch from tech to finance (other than for money obv).

4. It's been said many times in this subreddit before, but don't sleep on OS, comp arch, graphics, distributed systems. These are all notoriously difficult classes but all give you a better chance at interviewing in high-frequency trading. Naturally, building low-latency systems requires a strong foundation in all the above, save for graphics which just gives you a great command of C++.

5. Replace your projects for more relevant projects in performant languages. Build an orderbook, a simulated market maker, unix-like shell, webserver, or whatever you'd like. There are many tutorials online for all of these things, just make sure you can explain them.

Showed up for the interview and the recruiter never came. I emailed them to see what happened and I got an automatic email back from the recruiter saying he was no longer in that position. Then I got an email from another employee who said he quit unceremoniously and left the recruitment process in disarray. She then got me rescheduled for the next week. Went to that interview where the interviewer thanked me for doing the previous two interviews. I was very confused as this was my first interview with them but I went with it. I didn’t want to seem stupid at a FAANG interview. The chat before hand went great. But then the coding. I couldn’t remember Python syntax and had to write a lot of it in pseudo code. It was a mess. I even asked if I could google it and obviously he said no. That interview ended and I was pretty sure that was me doomed. Then I get an email to schedule another call to discuss my results.

- better return offer chances (??) idk my interviewers kept mentioning return offers
- free food (and apparently really good)
- more interesting area (going to be a tpm for ai team)

Cons:
- less pay than Microsoft
- less stipend for relocation (also won’t allow me corporate housing since I’m “local” to the area)


Pros for Microsoft:
- higher pay
- more prestige?
- allowing me to do corporate housing 
- going to tpm for azure -&gt; more familiar w msft’s core product 

Cons:
- big tech = less impact??
- no free food :-("
csMajors,Switch major or any tips in general?,1667681173,  So I’m currently first year CS major (yes I understand it’s very soon to even be giving this much thought had a very rough first semester) but I realize now it’s a lot more math based and hoped for more programming courses rather than math. I’m a first gen and very new to tech I just know I’ve been interested in computers since a child. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on whether I should switch to a more program based major or just stick with my major? It’s very overwhelming thinking about internships and projects with no coding knowledge and I’m aware the tech field is more experience based than anything. So should I toughen out with CS and self teach coding languages? Or think about switching majors?

csMajors,Renege Amazon for Khan Academy (Summer 2023 Internship)?,1667677265,"Accepted Amazon a month ago already but just received an offer for Khan Academy. I'm a sophomore, so I still have another year of internships. Also from a mid-tier CS co-op school, so Amazon would actually help my resume decently. Very sad cause Khan Academy actually seems like a cool company to work for (minus lower pay, but it's non-profit).

I'll write about the Khan Academy process in another post since that was missing information in Reddit when I was personally going through the process.

Amazon Pros:

* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* High pay + housing stipend (standard 9138/mo + 2400 relo stipend).
* Higher brand name/prestige as big tech, would make future internships much easier to obtain.
* Won't have to renege.
* Already made a LinkedIn post and farmed profile views.

Amazon Cons:

* Probably going to be low-impact work on internal tooling that never sees the light of day.
* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* Potential to do boring front-end-only work or do 80hrs in an AWS team (?).

&amp;#x200B;

Khan Academy Pros:

* I would genuinely be making an impact on the world. From my discussions in the interviews, it feels that the intern projects help Khan Academy towards their goal.
* Work seems more fun as well.
* They only take 6 interns per year, so potentially intimate environment? And I'll probably be able to meet Sal Khan.
* Great culture and WLB.
* Aligns better with my profile (my main resume project is EdTech, my main uni club experience is working with non-profits).

Khan Academy Cons:

* Probably riskier in these macroeconomic times.
* Remote. My last internship was remote and it was not that fun.
* Lower pay ($46.15/hr) and no relo stipend (I think).
* Less prestige(?) - likely would be harder to secure future internships.
* Would have to delete Amazon LinkedIn post and pretend it never happened (but at least I can farm more profile views for Khan Academy??)"

I’m taking System Analysis and Design this term and we had to make groups of 3/4 students to complete a class project (designing a system) of ten parts (SSR, Gantt chart, system requirements, use case, DFD, activity diagram, ER diagram, class diagram, system prototype, and a presentation about our fictional system, it’s uses, and the process of making it).

We started by dividing the parts on each student but I want us to at least do the first three steps as a group so - as those parts are the foundation of system we’ll be making. Without a proper understanding of the system, the following 7 steps will be harder to do. But they kept putting it off and delaying that i had to do them myself so we’d have enough time to do the diagrams, prototype, and the presentation.

Now that i have done 3/10 of the project, fairly, i wouldn’t have to be as involved in the following steps, right? I guess not. Because the person who were supposed to do the use case ended up making a use case of an entirely different system. The dumdum copied and pasted a random use case because they don’t even understand what the entire class is even about let alone the project or the fictional system. So i had to do it myself.

Step 5 and 6 went fine as the person who they were assigned to did them with out a fuss or needing me to monitor/review their work. But they legitimately have a full time job and already warned us that they can only work and meet on the weekends so i can’t relay on them much. Now come the next steps? Neither of the other two know how to do them, and both of them used the excuse of “sick family member”, not that i have any remaining trust the dumdum anyways.

So now, here i am, contemplating not including the other two’s named in neither of the project as a whole or the presentation. I’m so fed up with people riding my back to get their degree."
csMajors,Frustrated indie developer looking for willing users to try my app,1667649204,"Hi fellow redditors,

I have recently developed and launched an MVP of Confluo app, a task assistant, for getting task recommendations, building skills and network, and keeping your followers apprised.

I came up with this idea during the covid lockdowns when I was learning and doing a lot of new things and I felt others were engaged in other activities but because of the lockdowns we all felt isolated, and no one had an idea on what others were up to. To cope with the situation, many people started hosting virtual study and working sessions on discord, meetup, or zoom, many of which I have also joined. Essentially these sessions put you in a video or audio call that gives you a feeling of accountability as you work with others.

Even though lockdowns are over, the virtual sessions are not. Our work and study have increasingly shifted online. But I feel having to connect through a video or audio call while studying or working is an overkill and doesn't apply to all kinds of activities, such as running, sports or gym. So, I introduced a highlight field in a task that would get shared with others as the task is added to the calendar. IMO, sharing with others the highlights of what you're working on should be enough to build accountability without having to attend a video or audio session.

On the other hand, when it came to managing my tasks and activities, I felt no matter which task management app I used I would stop using it after a while. The problem wasn't that managing tasks through the app was difficult. Rather, the app didn't provide any incentive other than push notifications for me to open it. Opening such apps wasn't a joy. Instead, they demanded certain level of determination and discipline.

As we have an inherent desire to find out what our friends and followers are up to, I think having a feed of highlights shared by others should make the app enjoyable to open and keep it engaging.

Finally, I also wanted to track the skills and the number of hours I have worked, So I also included an option to add skills to each task. As I add a task to the calendar its corresponding skills get added to my profile for the duration of the task.

My current problem is I'm finding it difficult to test it with willing participants and get their thoughts. I have of course shared it with my friends. But being an introvert, I hardly have 10 close friends and family members and not all of them use apps for managing tasks. Nonetheless, a couple of them tested it and gave me some useful feedback which I have already incorporated to simplify parts of it.

Hence, I'm reaching out to you redditors if you would be interested in giving it a try. The app doesn't feature any advertisement and all the features I've mentioned above are completely free as I am not looking to make money, just trying to validate if people would use an app like this. Nor I'm looking to promote the app. I would be happy if just 50-100 people use the app and provide me some direct feedback on their experience rather than 1000s of people without any feedback.

I have programmed it in flutter so it's available on both Android and iOS. If you're interested, please go to [https://confluo.app](https://confluo.app) and give it a go. But more importantly, please DM me your thoughts. Thanks!"

csMajors,Deloitte vs Dish vs Raytheon vs CVS Health for SDE Internship,1667624916,"I am a junior studying cs and have been lucky enough to receive offers from Deloitte as a Consulting Software Developer Intern, Dish as an Application Development Intern, Raytheon as a SDE intern, and CVS health as a SDE intern. I have read that Deloitte is a nightmare to work for and a career killer but am not sure if I should choose a less well known company over Deloitte for an internship.

Looking at post grad salaries CVS seems to be the highest but intern pay is the lowest. Does anyone have any advice on the best reputation company and which choice may lead to the best chances of landing a better job after graduation?"

csMajors,Things I did to get big tech internships,1667623807,"I have wanted to write this post for a long time, but since I finally got done with recruiting for summer 2023 I decided to finally write this. In this post, I will be telling you how I broke into tech. For context, I went from failing every single Online Assessment to getting offers from multiple medium - big tech companies including FAANG and multiple social media companies (non-FAANG) in a year. While I believe everyone's journey in tech is very different, I do think if someone gets the basics right and works hard enough they can break into tech, and here I will try to summarize all the resources and tips I used to achieve what I wanted to. I gave a friend these tips and he used them to get his dream internship and that too in a recession ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:** I go to a T5 CS school but I am an international student so while I did have some advantages, I had a lot of disadvantages during my job search. Small companies wouldn't hire me so I could not get much experience and big companies wouldn't hire me because I did not have much experience. Breaking this cycle was very very challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started college in the Fall of 2019 as an ECE major but switched to CS before the end of the school year. I took the Data Structures class in the Fall of 2020 and the Algorithms class in the Spring of 2021. While my grades in school were amazing, I struggled with a lot of school assignments and barely made an A. I knew the theory but I barely understood how to apply Data Structures and Algorithms to technical questions and, this ultimately translated into poor interview performance and no internships for two consecutive summers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What changed:** During the summer of 2021, while all my friends were already working at their SWE internships, I did a minimum wage part-time job at my school and spent the rest of the time mainly on leetcode. I started with a pace of 3 questions a day and went up to 10 questions a day. The number of questions depended on the topic I was doing. I am not a genius by any means, and it takes me quite a bit of time to understand a lot of these concepts but I was willing to spend that time. Initially, the easy questions, like valid parenthesis, took me more than 3 hours to understand but it has gotten a lot better and I am currently at about 600 questions with about 150 easy questions, 370 medium questions, and 80 easy questions. I also did some mock interviews with a friend (he is such a GOAT) so I could get constructive feedback which I could use to improve myself. I took a light course load in the Fall 2021 semester and focused on leetcode and recruiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how you could get started with leetcode and achieve a similar result:

1.  Learn the very basics of Data Structures. This ([https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)) seems like a great place to start.
2. As soon as you learn your first Data Structure, do leetcode for that topic and continue learning other data structures.
3. In the interest of time, you can look up the solution after 1 hour of trying.
4. After you do one question do similar questions. Try to draw connections between these questions and apply the concept you just learned.
5. Don't lose hope, leetcode is hard for everyone.
6. Repeat and keep doing it until you understand the data structures well.   


**Here are some lists of questions that I think are good**:

1. [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)
2. [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\\\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none)
3. https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/

&amp;#x200B;

I did not follow any list when I started. I first did all the topics and once I started getting interviews I did tag questions for the company which enables me to do so many questions. I am not sure if these lists contain the same questions but they do seem to contain some of the best leetcode questions. Go in the following order while completing questions in these lists:

1. Blind 75
2. neetcode 150
3. grind 75
4. sean prashad

Once you finish these lists, do as many questions on leetcode as you can. Try doing at least medium difficulty. As I said above, it is okay to look up solutions as long as you understand why the solution works. I would suggest making a leetcode account so all the progress is in one place. You can also use lintcode to access leetcode premium questions. Some of the best solutions I found on leetcode were in the discuss section (sort by most votes for best results). While I did throw a lot of information here, I understand going through hundreds of questions is not possible for everyone but I highly recommend following the lists I mentioned above. I also suggest joining this discord server if you are recruiting for an internship / new grad job. One more thing, ask people for referrals either from your friends or people on LinkedIn. Maybe it becomes the reason you get your dream job. Please be kind to yourself and the people around you :)

I was in the Bay Area last summer, so hoping to live in NY or Seattle. 

**Datadog:**

NY

$52/hr + 6k housing stipend

Pros: lunch MWF, everyone I know who’s worked there *really* enjoys it, strong intern and new grad program, high return to full time rate, nice NY office

Cons: I don’t know much about the name value (I haven’t heard of it until this recruiting cycle)

**Atlassian:**

Remote (I can choose to go into any office)

$54/hr (SF), $49/hr (NY) + 3k stipend

Pros: I’ve used their product before and like it enough, know their name value, heard about great culture, lunch daily

Cons: The remote situation; worried that most people won’t go into office when I’m looking for an in person experience, less comp, a little more of a coasting company

**Asana:**

SF

$75/hr + 1.5k stipend

Pros: I’m most passionate about their product, breakfast + lunch daily, heard there’s decent culture, could potentially move to NY office for new grad (but not sure abt this)

Cons: not in NY

* No housing/transportation provided (would have to pay $5,000 in rent for total duration)
* $80k/yr and $10k bonus for new grad return offer

Walmart SWE Internship:

* Sunnyvale, California 
* $37/hr, 11 weeks
* Housing/transportation both provided
* Not sure about new grad offer, but 6-figures I'm sure just cause its the bay area

I even reneged a good internship offer for the one I took over the summer for the hopes of it making my resume more competitive (and I am most likely blacklisted, as I applied again this year but haven't receieved a single response).

Progressive Insurance is $24/hr for 12 weeks and is remote

I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I would have to pay for housing, food, gas, etc. if I go with BNY Mellon, but with Progressive I could work from home, so I think it would probably be a similar amount of money in the end (let me know if my thinking here is incorrect). 

I'm also not sure which internship would have more interesting work. I know someone who interned at BNY Mellon, and he said he basically just wrote JUnit tests all summer which doesn't sound that appealing. He did mention that other interns got put on more interesting projects though. I also like the idea of being in person. At the Progressive info session, they said their interns get assigned to a project and then a side project of their choosing, so it sounds like it might be more engaging?

Has anyone interned at either of these two companies for SWE? Any other factors that I should be considering? Any insight is appreciated!

csMajors,"No internships, failed coding interview, got offer!",1667580795,"I wanted to post this because I have seen some of the things posted on here about how screwed you will be without internships, grinding LC, and all of that. I started to believe this too and thought there was little chance of me getting a job (May grad). Of course these are good things to do and have, but I think it gets exaggerated on here.   

I went to a recruiting event at my college and ended up having a really good conversation with a recruiter for the company. I sent my application in, took my OA, and then did the phone screen which led to the technical interview. I studied the questions posted on Glassdoor, but ended up getting a different coding question. I answered all the OOP based questions well and had a really good talk with the interviewer. For the coding question, I didn’t pass a single test case and was going back to fix my code when he stopped me. He told me that he was actually just looking to see my thought process and how I went about solving it and that I was on the right track. Anyone I asked told me that since I got the question wrong I was cut and someone even told me I should be embarrassed I didn’t get it.    

Anyways, I end up getting moved to the final round which is supposedly behavioral. Well, they pull out another coding question haha. I did better on this one, but ultimately didn’t quite get it in time. We actually talked through it after he stopped me and I was correct, just had a couple things out of order. Once again, this interviewer also told me that the main thing was my communication skills and thought process. 

A week later I received an offer and this is the company I have wanted to work at since I started college. From reading here and Discord, I had multiple people tell me that there is no shot, so I was really surprised because I had started to believe them lol. They said that they really enjoyed how I went about the problems and communicated clearly. My point in posting this is not to brag or anything close. To the people that feel they have no hope because of internships, LC, or whatever it is - this isn’t true! I don’t see as many people on here talk about the importance of communicating and having good conversation during the interviews. In my head, I was thinking either way I want to have learned something from the devs that interview me and this lead to good vibes during the interview.     

Keep working to get internships and grinding LC, but do not think you are totally screwed and will never get a job otherwise. Practice your communication skills, connect with people, and just try to bring good personality to the interview!"

csMajors,Not sure what to do new grad,1667537106,"So I've received a FAANG offer in the bay and want to take it, however I live in the midwest and plan on staying in the midwest close to family and friends long term. I also have an offer from a company where I can stay near family and friends but the company is far less prestigious. I feel that if I took the FAANG offer I would have far better opportunities down the road, but I don't want to regret missing out on time spent with family and friends.

csMajors,Take Calc III to add a math minor?,1667535057,"I am a part time / older student / ~20 years into my career already.  Finally in home stretch to complete a BS after a lot of starts and stops. I am registering for my last semester, and I only have one kind of fluffy elective left to take, and can optionally add Calc III to complete a math minor.

I didnt have an easy time with Calc I or II, but still pushed through to get As, and have reviewed periodically to keep it fresh. I did a pretty intense review about 9 months ago leading up to taking Physics II last semester. I took Calc I and II 15+ years ago, but still seems to click for me when I go through text books and exercises.

I am not really sure what my long term plans are for the future. I could see myself continuing with an MS program. Near term I want to get into more interesting work, proper SWE of some sort. Stuck in an ops/eng/admin world now and while it pays well its boring and aggravating work. 

Would it be better to spend more time going through DSA texts and ""grinding leetcode"" to buff up for SWE roles, or would having Calc III and a math minor be useful to convince some grad school that its worth accepting an older adult? Could it come in handy in its own right for SWE roles? 

I had previously convinced myself I would go for it. Now that I am in the tail end of the degree the lazy part of me just wants to be done with as little effort as possible. Could use some nudges one way or the other.

I am reading past posts where this was asked from others now as well.

TLDR: The goal is a higher starting salary, BS in CS + MS in CS is easier but both are reasonable

Currently, a freshman majoring in CS with no declared minor or double major. I was planning out all 4 years and I realized I could get a master's on top of my BS in four years. It's just a matter of choosing what to get the master's in. If I choose CS it would not be that difficult since my school allows a lot of overlap when it comes to BS and Graduate requirements. I would have to either overload my schedule or take a couple of courses over the summer (asynchronously or online) but I would be taking less rigorous courses like Humanities. If I choose an MBA it would require more effort since there's a lot less overlap but it's still doable. This leads to the question of which is worth pursuing. I enjoy CS but the priority is getting the highest starting salary possible as a new grad. Which would be more advantageous? Thanks in advance.

Other Possible Information:

\-T100 school - nothing super impressive

\-On full-ride so nothing would be out of pocket (only if I do it in 4 years though)

\-This is all with internships in mind for future summers

I’m currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms where I have a 100 average, but any faith I have from my experience there is squandered by the LeetCode/OA cycle.

I don’t have any interviews yet after 100 applications. After 3 months of LeetCode, I can’t solve a Medium independently ever, I always require at least a 1 line hint to flesh out a solution myself. I almost never complete an OA without looking for some help online on strategy first, and when I am fully capable of completing an OA, it’s because it was easy enough for an idiot like me to do and the company is less likely to interview me since an oversupply of competing applicants passed their test cases as well (banking / insurance).

I sometimes find practice coding questions from company specific questions and continue to get bamboozled by them when I try to simulate Hackerrank environments.

I feel like everyone else’s job prospects far exceed mine and I can’t seem to catch up to where I should be as a hopeful SWE. I just fail and the next 3 years of my career are in jeopardy if I don’t make an internship this summer.

csMajors,"Application process results after ~20 applications (offer at SWE, HFT)",1667497095,"Hi all,

For background, I'm a sophomore CS undergrad at a world top 5 uni (not US). I had interned before twice at a medium sized company (that no one of you has heard of), and only really started applying to internships at big companies for next summer.

Summary of my applications:

* Withdrawn: 2
* Ghosted: 5 (includes post-OA)
* Rejected: 6 (includes post-OA)
* Phone interview: 5 (cancelled rest of them after my 2 offers)
* Onsite: 2
* Offer: 2 (one at a well-known public company, other at a top HFT)

I feel very lucky having received an offer in this climate. I feel that applying early (started late August) really helped my chances as most people I know didn't start until October. I was also surprised at how few LC questions I needed to be interview-ready. Communication while problem-solving and being a nice person overall helped me much more.

This post is also to give hope to some of you who believe you need to be an IOI medallist or a math genius to get a SWE offer at HFTs. I am probably smarter than the average person but I am nowhere near the level of some of my peers at uni. My initial target for # of apps was 400, so I wouldn't give up, especially if you try applying to some smaller local companies."

Pretty much every great SWE I know has been ghosted or rejected by Microsoft and they seem to be hiring more beginner SWEs (myself included since I was a beginner SWE when I interviewed a few years ago and did not have nearly as much experience as my fellow SWEs - was very surprised when I got the offer).

I also have a friend that's busting their butt off and grinding this recruiting season but they're not having a lot of luck landing interviews. I feel so bad since they're working so hard getting nothing while the people around them seem to be getting interviews left and right. Their resume seems great and they're able to comfortably solve Leetcode Mediums and have a good learning mindset.

Walmart is $30/hr + 3k housing/relocation OR corporate housing.

Both are in Dallas, TX, which I live close to. My plan is to pocket the housing money while living at home and drive ~40 minutes to both offices.

State Farm is hybrid/fully remote, while Walmart is in-person. 

My dilemma is that the drive to State Farm is more manageable due to hybrid/remote status, which means I’ll be able to pocket the housing money. However, Walmart is in-person and a 40 min drive both ways, which likely means I’d pick corporate housing and lose out on pocketing the money.

I have a few questions:

- Does Walmart have better name value than Stare Farm for resume purposes?
- Assuming I do pick corporate housing and Walmart’s compensation package becomes lower than State Farm, which do I pick?

I decided I want to get proper education cause I like CS and I got a scholarship in another country so I went for it but boy am I having second thoughts. The program is bombarding me with artificially difficult stuff like, it's all about solving coding exercises in ridiculously short amounts of time and memorizing syntax for quizes. Almost all professors are trash (with only a few exceptions) so time spent is most lectures feels wasted and I need to use all my time to relearn stuff using other sources. Nobody gets to the heart of the subject, it's just exercise after exercise. If they're teaching a paradigm, for e.g functional programming, it's just going to be straight exercises and no explanation of its foundations and building blocks. Oh and don't get me started on maths, for some fucking reason, there seems to be a tendency to RUN to the next concept. I checked MIT videos and the professors there speak slowly, in a matter that's understandable and help you build intuition. None of that here. 

I usually have a hard time doing things I don't enjoy. I need some spark otherwise it's straight agony. I'm fucking hating this so far but on the other hand I'm hopping it's getting better next semesters. Also I heard that in all the electives I was thinking of choosing the following years, the professors are batshit insane. I wanted to choose compilers but everyone is warning me against it. Like what's the point? If I want to learn something for fun, I could have retreated to a cabin in the woods with a bunch of decent programming books and would probably have a better time.

After experiencing that third part I feel so dumbfounded and am honestly rethinking my views on the company now. I was lucky enough that the question asked was very simple (actually one I've encountered before so right off the bat I knew of a solution). But as I was typing up my answer the interviewer stopped me because I used a formula he wasn't aware of and basically forced me to restart and implement it another way. This caught me off guard cause I'm 100% sure the way I was answering it didn't violate anything. Also i was told that the point of the technical was to see if I am 1) able to explain my thinking/actions and 2) solve it. Emphasis on explaining my logic. But the interviewer just wouldn't let me code how I felt was right or even hear me out when i tried to explain myself. He would ask me a question and I'd start talking but then he'd just cut me off- sometimes to repeat the same thing I just said. At some point, he even deleted my code to force me to restart, or would give me ""hints"" that would just cause errors and then he'd revert the change and explain it to me as if it was my own actions that caused the mistake.

In the end, I just knew he had a poor judgement of me cause he even shaded me during his closing remarks basically saying I should've just taken his advice to restart without question.

I don't know of this is a common experience but I feel pretty crummy about this. I'm worried my chances are now ruined. Is this a common thing to encounter during a technical? Should I be prepared for another instance of this?"

I've been fortunate enough to get offers for DataDog and Bloomberg this upcoming Summer. I'm wondering people think about which program is better!

Location: Both in NYC, 11 Weeks

Salary: The same

Housing: Bloomberg corporate housing or stipend, DDOG stipend only, \~1k higher than BB

Relocation: Bloomberg \~2k, DDOG flights to and from NYC covered

General Intern Life: Both seem to have a very robust intern program (lots of events, socials, networking chances, meaningful work)

Given the offers are almost identical similar, I'm more curious about what the general opinion is on which company has more opportunities/chances for growth/recognizability.

   * Pros: 
      * Larger company usually = more stability
      * Higher intern pay (but I've heard there's basically no raise for the return offer new grad pay, which sucks)
      * Better name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year
      * Higher full-time return offer rate
   * Cons: 
      * Unsure if I want to work at a bank since engineers aren't prioritized as much
      * Don't like top-down, very corporate formal culture

Zocdoc: a later-stage health-tech startup that is pre-IPO, used to financially not do so well but switched business plans a few years ago and now doing better

* NYC
* $40.96/hr ($7100/mo)
* $5400 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 2-3 weeks in the office
* 10 weeks
* 10 SWE interns in total for next year
* 50% full-time return offer rate and the team I return to depends on what I want and what business needs are
* My thoughts on it so far:
   * Pros:
      * Larger scope project since startup
      * I feel more passionate about health tech than finance
      * Better work culture and prioritization of engineers since it's a tech company
   * Cons:
      * Pay is not very high for NYC's cost of living
      * Worser name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year 
      * Lower full-time return offer rate 
      * Full-time return offer is stock options and not RSU

I've heard for both the impact of your project and how much you will learn are team-dependent.

Any opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!

But they are only paying me 18$/hr.

csMajors,Feel shitty about myself for keep failing at practicing coding questions,1667442871,"
I’m a senior CS. I’ve been hustling since freshman and knew how important grinding Leetcode is to get a foot to big tech companies. But I’m terrible at it. Practice coding questions has became a black hole to me.

My first time planning to do Leetcode was in Summer 2020. I spent 2-3 hours every day until I solved around 30 questions but couldn’t figure out their patterns. The second attempt was signing up for an Algorithms courses so that I could have deadlines and an actual instructor/TA/office hours to get the work done. I failed again because their comprehensive materials and I can’t put up with 20 hours every week to do homework while having 15 credit hours at school and a part-time job. At the third attempt, I decided to pay a big buck to have a private TA to guide me through this painful process, but my internship keeps me super busy to do anything else on the side. Even I made it to the end but I only grasp 70% of the materials and still couldn’t solve a single graph questions without asking for help. My latest attempt was 3 months ago when I decided to go the traditional way — solving only one problem as the first task daily following the  Neetcode150 list. Unfortunately, 18 credit hours and a part-time internship hit me again. I was too stress out to put my head into solving the problem, I got into the shit hole and take a break from coding challenges. The break now take months and I wanted to give up on Leetcode-type questions. But as an international student, getting into big tech comp secures me sponsorship. I now feel shitty about myself, my ability, and my future plan. It started to give me some mental breakdown. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know if I post something on here would help but I really need to let it out.

FYI, all of my passed interview weren’t involved to any Leetcode-type questions. I had 2 internships and a full-time offer that is too low ball (70k with little compensation). That’s why I keep wanting to try, but I’m too exhausted at the same time."

Strategically placed tl;dr: have personal programming exp, am starting CS at uni in 3 months, is working a part-time cs job worth it and manageable? How difficult is getting a cs part time job / internship?
I'm starting my CS degree at a university in South Africa next year in February. I'd like to hear opinions and experiences from fellow CS students / grads who took up a part-time CS-related job during their studies. Below follows a bit of background on my experiences with programming so far.

I've been programming and learning about computers on a software level for quite a few years now, having messed with Javascript when I was 12 or so (didn't get very far at the time). Currently I'm halfway through a medium sized personal Android Studio project using Java, and have some Python experience, as well as 3 years of Delphi from high school (yes, Delphi..). Without sounding full of myself, I think it is of value to note that I score 98% on my practical examinations, so I'm fairly good at what is expected of me at this level, which is honestly stuff I could do 3 years ago..

I'm very enthusiastic about CS, keen to get into the math and theory as well, as I'm always curious about how things work and the problem-solving required to work with software.

As much as university seems exciting now, I know I definitely need some real-world experience to land a good job straight out of university, and I do plan on applying for internships (vacation based, so like a month twice a year) next year already (our academic year is Feb-Dec), but is it possible to work a part-time job / internship during semester months and still manage some shape of a life and spend enough time on my modules? Follow-up, how difficult is it in general to land a part-time job in CS during uni, and does it sound like I'm on the right track? Thanks! Any other tips you have for me around anything I said are welcome as well :)"

I recently got an offer for Optum's (United Health Group) Technology Development Program internship for Summer 2023 and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this program and could tell me if it is worth it to take the offer. I have two weeks to get back to them but I also wanted to wait to hear back from other companies that I applied for. They offer options in your work schedule such as remote but I wanted to get out of my hometown and opted to be in-person because I wanted to be in a different environment. 

**If anyone interned there I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me:**

**- Your experience or opinions of the experience**

**- technology stack or projects** 

**- work culture**

**- any intern activities or opportunities to connect or hang out with the team**

&amp;#x200B;

\- NC office at Raleigh if you've worked there, which looks cool as it's in the Bank Of America Tower. It's on Six Forks Road if you want to check it out

I've heard about Optum's chill environment and laid-back culture but wanted more details as I couldn't find much about the NC office and the amenities or facilities it offers. 

It's a healthcare company so I'm not expecting too much with the technology stack.  They use the old Microsoft stack along with AngularJS so some stuff seems outdated in terms of cutting-edge technology. As long as I am learning I can't complain.

For context, I'm a junior CS major. I really care about meaningful projects, learning, the work environment, and opportunities to connect with others such as events or hangouts when deciding on offers. Any advice is appreciated."

csMajors,Microsoft TPM vs Amazon SDE Internship,1667400721,"Super grateful to receive both offers, but I'm really struggling with which one to choose. I'm not sure which career path I'd prefer in terms of SWE vs PM, but I know usually it's difficult to transition to SWE as a PM (but relatively easier the other way around). However in terms of company, Microsoft is much better. Here are the details:

Microsoft TPM

* 8k/month
* Corporate housing provided
* Redmond, WA
* Transportation stipend, free car rental

Amazon SDE

* 9k/month + 1.8k/month for housing
* Arlington, VA

I'm considering the following factors, and if anyone can provide further insight on these it'd be very much appreciated and helpful:

* Company culture/WLB (for FT + internship)
* Prestige (both company + role)
* Return offer rate
* SWE vs PM
* Future career prospects (which one would lead to better career prospects post internship, from what I've heard I believe SWE is better just because there are more SWE jobs and it's easier to transition from SWE to PM rather than the other way around)
* Location for full-time (ideally I'd like to be in New York/California, and I know Microsoft is typically mainly in Redmond but I'm not sure about Amazon)
* Salary (also mainly concerned with FT TC, I'm not sure how different it'd be for Microsoft TPM vs Amazon SDE)

For anyone who interned at Amazon in the past or has any insight, would it be possible to defer my offer from summer to fall or winter? I know they typically don't allow it but I've heard of certain situations where people were able to.

csMajors,I have a Bs.c in software engineering and i’m moving to the US. should i get a masters degree in computer science?,1667366650,"Okay to give you a brief description of my situation. I just graduated with a B.sc degree in software engineering from a Nigerian university. I already have my US green card, i would be moving there soon. I am a pretty good javascript(MERN) programmer and have some projects , however i know how competitive the job market is. I have no prior industry experience as a software engineer. I am obviously open to gaining that first trash junior developer job just so that i could have something to potentially put on my resume and gain some experience, however my parents want me to pursue a masters degree because they feel i would have a better chance to get a good starting salary (they seem to think that i can just start making 3 figures). i’m not that naive to think that a company would pay someone with no experience very high just cause he has a masters degree, been trying to tell them for a long time that company’s prefer working experience to a masters degree. so i came here to get opinions.

1.)  As an international student with a degree from a nigerian school, would companies not take my B.sc seriously just because it’s not from an american school?

2.) would a master’s degree help me stand out to employers when i’m job searching? (even tho the recruiter required only a B.sc)

3.) would it be wise to start the masters programme while still job searching and then leave the programme if i find a reasonable job or would it be wiser to continue developing my programming skills till i find a reasonable job or a junior level position?

4.) if i don’t have industry experience but i’ve built many real-world based personal projects over the course of about two years. should i still be applying for junior positions due to my lack of industry experience or should i apply to mid level jobs?"

I’m literally saying this from personal experience. I came in with barely any comp sci experience. Most of my friends barely worked hard and got As but I had to put in a lot of effort even in the intro classes. But I never gave up and went to office hours so often. Sophomore year I basically lived in office hours. I have so many friends who were my TAs earlier and I have learnt everything from them. I networked wherever I went. It’s simple, just network well enough and you’ll definitely get something.

It’s a grind for sure, but in the end if you put in effort ,you’ll definitely be fine. I’m not the best at technical interviews but I got an offer at a Fortune 100 for next summer.

csMajors,Need advice: Feeling burnt out and unmotivated during my internship,1667361315,"Sorry this is so long! I just really need to get this off my chest, and I included a TL;DR below! I am currently a sophomore taking 18 credits this semester, alongside a full-time internship at a well-paying unicorn and significant involvement in university project teams/organizations. Since I wasn't allowed to take the semester off due to the requirements of one of my degrees, the company allowed me to work around my class schedule while still working 40 hours a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 6 weeks left of the internship, including this week, and my design doc just got approved for me to start on my project. I really like the project and team, and am learning a lot, but it's a full-stack project and is taking me a lot of time to learn all of the different components, so I'm worried I won't be able to pull everything together in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my manager today, and apparently he didn't realize I was a sophomore who has only finished up till Data Structures and Algorithms and he thought I was a junior/senior who had taken advanced electives in Databases, Web Systems, etc. when he assigned me to the team/project. He then said that the company moves very quickly, and they don't have time for ""hand-holding"" and explaining a lot of things. My mentor and I only meet once a week, and it's hard to check in with them about my questions too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have a good internship already lined up for the summer, for which I didn't have my current company on my resume, so I'm not really interested in getting a return offer. Even though I'm liking the tech I'm working with, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and unmotivated because I know that I don't need the return offer, I'm not able to implement the tools as quickly as they want me too, I have coursework and project teams on my plate which I need to prioritize so that I don't fall behind, and my manager was expecting someone who already took courses on databases, web systems, etc. and didn't know that I'm not there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My internship project is cool but I don't know anything, have a lot on my plate, and my manager was expecting someone with a lot more experience and doesn't want to have to explain stuff to me, which is fair. Since I have a better summer internship already, I'm not that interested in a return offer. I don't want to quit because I don't want to disappoint them, or myself, but I also don't know how to handle the situation anymore."

csMajors,Stripe vs @m@zon Internship,1667355361,"I worked at m@zon last summer and had a very mediocre time. It definitely wasn’t bad, but I didn’t love it. For the most part, I think this is how the average m@zon intern feels about m@zon, though.

Pros:

Had a VERY good work-life balance (a lot of life and not a lot of working)

Stable guarantee of a return offer (especially for full time next year)

Cons:

Didn’t get any free food or in-office amenities (I’m the kind of person that this means a lot to me)

Not very interested in what my team was doing

The way my manager acted towards the team and me definitely rubbed me the wrong way

Could not see myself working therefull time

I’m currently deciding between m@zon and Stripe for next year. My goal this year was to not work for m@zon, but given the current industry situation, it’s been tough getting offers. My current options are to keep m@zon and keep recruiting, or accept Stripe. If I keep m@zon and keep recruiting, in the worst case, I have to work for m@zon again so that’s 2 years of m@zon on my resume that might hurt my chances when I re-recruit for full time. I also am very unsure if companies are still hiring and if I will be able to secure another offer at another company at this point. My main reservation behind choosing Stripe is that I hear Stripe has a terrible work-life balance which is important to me. Is this the case for the interns as well? I also heard Stripe doesn’t give out a lot of return offers and that also worries me. I’m not necessarily that interested in fin-tech so honestly I probably will be just as uninterested in what my team is doing at Stripe as I am at m@zon, but at this point just kind of trying to make the best decision for my future.

Any insight would be helpful. Thanks for everything!"

csMajors,"Feeling like I learned nothing in 2.5 years of my comp sci degree. Want to start over, how do I go about it?",1667350186,"


I’ll start by saying this: It is entirely my fault that I haven’t been putting as much effort into my CS degree as I should have. I started attending university in 2020 for a 4 year CS degree and I worked just hard enough so I could pass my classes with decent grades. However, I did not put as much effort into actually LEARNING outside of my courses as I should have. And now I’m in my 3rd year and suddenly had an eye opening moment that made me want to learn everything from scratch because my basics are not as solid as they should be. I don’t even know how I would get a job or even an internship when I graduate in a year and a half. How should I go about this? Is it even possible for me to get back on track alongside doing my college courses?

Principles of CS
Theoretical foundations of CS
Data structures
System level programming

csMajors,What could I be doing wrong? Not getting interviews,1667349453,"I've applied to at least 200 positions since September for a Spring/Summer co-op/internship for 2023.

I applied to all kinds of companies, mostly local companies and startups, top tech companies, banks, FAANG and FAANG level companies. I was hoping to at least get an interview from a FAANG level company, but I haven't heard anything. The top company I interviewed with was Cisco.

I just started my second year and I think I have good experience. I did two short internships in high school, and a summer internship (not in the USA) after my first-year. On top of that, I would say I have good side projects (published a mobile app, many other websites on GitHub) which I can talk about during interviews.

What could I be doing wrong? I've already posted by resume for review on other subs, though my school's career advisor gave it a green flag. I have done less than 5 interviews, all of which went well."

Mainly between the unicorn and the consulting company. All are SWE internships. Sorry for not saying some of the companies, some of them have small intern sizes.

Unicorn would be swe @ cybersecurity, which I think would make me more money after grad, but I'm not particularly interested in this field. However, it is in the tech field, and I haven't had that experience yet.

BCG dv would be swe, and gives out more money for their internship, but I have this feeling that it wouldn't make me as much money after grad. It seems like an interesting field however, but it isn't really in the tech field, so I worry it wouldn't open as much doors as having a tech company on my resume.

csMajors,Feeling so tired and burnt out with job applications,1667324856,"Just wanted to share how I’m feeling rn. I’m mentally exhausted with job applications for grad schemes. Previously, companies separated assessments like situational test, video interview and coding test so you only do the next one if you pass the previous stage. Now, they make you do all of them immediately after you’ve submitted your online application. I’m spending every weekend completing all these assessments and whenever I receive a rejection, I just gotta sweep it aside and hustle for the next one. 

This time last year I was in the exact spot applying for a placement role. I hustled so much and submitted hundreds of applications. I’m really thankful to get 3 offers and currently doing my placement at a company I love. However, now I’m just drained because this time I need to find a sponsorship as an international student and the application process is getting more tedious. 

I’d rather be rejected from the beginning if the recruiter feels my cv is not good enough instead of spending hours on mandatory assessments only to be rejected with no feedback. Companies say it’ll only take 120 mins for their assessments, but do they know that preparing for those recorded video interviews takes hours of research and practice? 

Okay back to hustling mode."

I've tried my hardest to work with the people in my lecture and lab groups but it feels like an insurmountable task. I honestly feel like they purposely put people who have good CS skills with people who don't. I had no complaints until it was clear lots of them don't care about explanations or getting better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any similar experiences as the semester is starting to heat up and the people clearly not cut for CS are dragging them down?"

csMajors,Microsoft TPM vs Goldman Sachs Quant Strat (Internship),1667266705,"Microsoft: Technical Program Manager, Business Cloud Org - Bellevue, WA

Goldman Sachs: Quant Strategy, Financial Analysis Org - NYC

TC is nearly identical and it doesn't matter to me for a summer internship. Cannot move either to off-season.

This will be my sophomore summer internship (applied to Goldman Sachs with a junior grad year tho). I'm really lucky to be in this position but would like opinions on a decision, especially considering that for my junior summer next year, I will be targeting prop shops/HFT firms like Jane Street, Citadel, 2Sigma for their Trading &amp; Quant Trading roles. GS would feed nicely into that, but I'd be bottlenecked into working in finance. Microsoft TPM opens more general doors in tech, fintech, and finance for all sides (e.g. Google, LinkedIn APM programs and quant TPM program).

Any input is appreciated!

The thing is, during my interview, when they asked me if I had any deadlines, I just told them I had a few other final interviews that week (truthfully). Now, I haven't heard back regarding final offers from any of the companies just yet, but the fact that the recruiter sent me this email asking specifically about alternate deadlines even though they will be telling me my offer results very soon makes me wonder if they actually want me to have other offers.

Plano TX

90K Salary

10K sign on bonus

IDK if theres stock stuff or other comp

In person :(

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I've been at the end of my rope since Fall 2019. Absolutely non-stop work, school, life problems. I am tired mann. I've worked my rear off for years and am now just wanting a job that will pay me well, give me good work life balance, and really really want remote flexibility. It's not just that I wanna work in my underwear, but I genuinely need/want to be at home taking care for family who NEED me. Being able to work remotely a part of the week would mean a lot to me. 

That said, I've done some basic research about JPMC as a whole. I don't like what I'm seeing. A lot of corporate bullshit, hard to get stuff done, long hours, employee tracking, personally the CEO comes off as very ""I own you"" to me. Salaries are underwhelming (I really wanted 100K minimum) and I was looking forward to getting $$$ in stock options but I don't see much about that

Apparently JPMC sets you up well for better opportunities at other companies in the future but I'm not sure how much I care for that right now. I've already been working ""towards my future"" for years. I've sacrificed so much, so much time, my friendships holding on by a thread, and now the thought of going straight from college to professional work? I want to have time for my hobbies finally, I want to spend time with my family, go out with friends, enjoy a moment to myself, but I feel like JPMC is ready to suck the life out of me. I have been waking up thinking about work, grinding all day, and going to bed thinking about work for years. I've solved homework/lab problems in my DREAMS for fucks sake

Should I tough it out? Im going to my school's career center to see what they think about negotiating the offer, but I wanna see what you guys think. I'm tired of being miserable thanks to school, I cannot keep suffering in professional industry too. I am already at my breaking point

If any of you have heard anything about JPMC Plano, let me know

csMajors,"People who actually make decent money from a ""side hustle"", what do you do and how did you get into it?",1667216330,"I'm a freelance proofreader. A lot of people publish on Amazon Kindle and such, not through traditional publishers. As such, they may not have editors or proofreaders, which leads to a lot of mistakes in their books. Typos, grammatical mistakes, missing words in a sentence, extra words (i.e. repeating a phrase twice in a row by accident), continuity errors in a book, etc.

I help with that, and because it's my side gig I only choose to take on clients whose books I actually enjoy. If I think your book is really bad, then I'm not going to do it. So far I've only been doing fantasy and sci-fi because that's what I enjoy and am familiar with.

I charge around $200-$300 per book, depending on the length (I charge per word). And those are low rates, as I haven't been doing it for that long. Experienced editors can charge double or even more.

As to how I got into it - I just started reading a lot of books on Kindle Unlimited and such, and realized there were a lot of already-published books with errors. I figured there would be some demand for an affordable editor.

But, you have to be very good at noticing mistakes, have an excellent grasp of English and all sorts of obscure grammatical rules, and be a fast reader/typer. Most people aren't all of these. If you're slow, then your hourly rate will be bad. A good memory helps too, for catching consistency issues or continuity errors.

csMajors,Anyone else feel like giving up on their internship search?,1667200974,"It's just impossible to get an internship rn.

I'm a junior in college right now but I transferred from CC, so my knowledge is nowhere close to my peers, causing me to perform ""average"" (if not below) in most of my OA's (mid/low 700 scores in CodeSignal). This is no where close enough to even get a phone call back in this year's competitive economy. 

I've applied to like 100 companies and probably got \~15 OA's back, but I've been ghosted after all of them. I don't think my resume is a problem because I asked a few peers, including one at a FAANG, and they said it was fine. (And yes, I asked this person for a referral, and got rejected from that company too). 

The obvious answer is for me to grind LeetCode and self-study, but university takes up almost all of my time, and by the time I get home after a long day I just want to sit in bed. I don't even have time to exercise. This [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y9ks9i/rant_about_attending_a_good_cs_school/) of someone who goes to my school summarizes it pretty well.

It's already November, and there are barely any companies left for me to even apply to, and even if I apply to like 100 more companies I'll probably fail the OA's because it's just not feasible for me to study hundreds of LC problems rn. 

I'm probably just going to sit in a dark room all Summer playing video games. :/

I was working on a programming assignment, and after making one too many mistakes, I lost the progress I had made over the past four hours. I was so close to being done, so I was devastated, to say the least.

Thankfully, I had made a few commits beforehand, and after about an hour of research and trying things out, I found a way to get to a commit that had most of my progress.

I was worried that I was wasting my time trying to figure out, but it was a relief when I did. I turned it in and am now making sure to save my progress often.

For some previous background on me, I go to a T30 CS school and currently a 3rd year student. I had zero SWE intern experience (had 2 previous tech related internship), basic projects, and very surface level understanding of CS topics.  Only thing I had going for me was good GPA and 400 LC (grinded over 80 days). I applied to 200+ places late September and only received rejections for the first month. I was defeated and was at the lowest point in my life. Felt I wasn’t good enough and was about to give up. But I kept going and rolled with the punches. Just this last weekend, I was able to get my dream position and I never felt more proud of myself. 

Trust me. Keep going. You’ll make it eventually as long as you don’t stop now.

csMajors,Is accepting 2 internships bad?,1667179284,"Need help weighing my options. 


For clarification:

1st internship runs Jan - March 2023 and is Malware Analyst. It is very stable even in this economy thanks to it being government related and necessary. Which in this economy, looks very nice/makes me lean more towards this one.

2nd internship runs June - Aug 2023 and is software engineering for a cloud marketplace company that does way more cutting edge actual software engineering. I would learn more engineering type skills and it would look better on my resume but I kind of doubt return offers will even be much of a thing considering the economy and it’s a relatively new company. 

Being a malware analyst, I will be extensively analyzing code just not coding anything myself. Which makes me feel meh but I’m also really excited about it regardless especially to be working with international law enforcement and the FBI. But the 2nd internship is more in my playing field and might look better. 

Technically, I could accept both since they don’t overlap, but my real concern here is what if the malware analyst internship offers me a full time job afterwards. The person who interviewed me basically said they give all their candidates return offers and they are always available, which was music to my ears in this economy. But if I already have the 2nd internship then I can’t take it and it’ll look bad if I cancel on the 2nd one and the interviewer said that’s their biggest pet peeve; ppl who back out, they want our answer to be final and binding basically. Not sure what to do here as they are both good opportunities in their own way. I haven’t given any answers to either yet.

Note: I feel like the only way I somehow got these offers was cause I started applying to smaller/more niche companies early on when everyone was aiming for FAANG and other exciting startups in my area. Somehow me doubting my skills/having imposter syndrome helped me here lol"

https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xnsbtk/am_i_not_a_cut_for_swe/

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn’t passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I’m an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer’22 internship. Didn’t get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. 

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn’t getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy. 

Fast forward today, I signed an offer as a Software Engineer at a pretty big corporation.

Currently a new grad so just applying to whatever companies as usual, and I got contacted by a third-party recruiter on LinkedIn about two Java positions, the first one, the recruiter mistakenly sent a Mercedes Benz exhaust showcase video as the link to the video introduction of the company (🚩). I gone through the documents, the pay for both are average/below-average for new-grads in the country, and I actually had a couple interviews that have been going pretty well and had offered more money at that point, but I thought more interviews doesn't hurt, so I responded that I'm interested in both.

No idea what happened to the first company, but he did arranged an interview to the second company, it's a small local company that has a semi-monopoly in a few fields in finance and insurance because of local regulations, and their entire tech stack is just Java with JSP and Java Servlet (🚩). Which doesn't sound pleasant but the recruiter also told me that the interview is a single round taking roughly 2 hours, so I thought why not proceed with it.

And then I was told that, the interview will consists of the usual behavior interviews, and a written test about Java with both code and theory. Yes, the interview expect you to handwrite Java code and SQL Queries. (🚩) I thought it's only one round, it will be a pain in the ass but whatever. The recruiter also told me that he will send an email over later with some tips about the interview, which was very nice of him.

Later I received the email from the recruiter and saw the ""tips"" that I was given, which is actually not the tips but just straight up the entire question sheets they will be asking me on the interview (🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩). I was just speechless by this point, he also made sure to mention that ""in order to avoid suspicion, do not score perfectly in the test"". I was flabbergasted and was not sure if this was part of the process of testing my integrity or not.

The day of the interview came, I went to the office, and was just given the test sheet and told to fill it in in the meeting room, and what do you know, its the exact same questionnaire that the recruiter gave me, I did looked up the answers beforehand but decide against just writing down all of it, instead fill in all the sections that I genuinely would have know if I went in blind and leave the rest as blank. During the behavior interviews (which was very straightforward) my mind just went blank and couldn't ask the interviewer any good questions during Q&amp;A as I was just shocked by the whole experience. And I kinda stopped giving a shit about the position and didn't told the interviewer the truth.

Got a call 2 days later and got rejected btw."

csMajors,"What class do you start coding in production level code instead of ""academic"" code",1667146136,"I'm doing C++ for reference and like all of my coursework thus far hasn't been as expansive as a legitimate code base.  We're not using a ton of libraries and idk how else to put it but the programming style we're doing now is just textbook example tier. Stuff where you just build up a few classes and a main thread from the ground up by yourself, unlike production level where where you have tons of files already made with distinct naming schemes and ambiguous relations between the files themselves.

On my own time I have tried doing a few personal projects or just browsing through open source repos, and I always find it so hard to parse through all the data and determine dependencies like ""in what file was this other file called"" and stuff like that. I am literally just using the vscode search feature to manually see if a class was used in another file. Even then, and this may be the wrong approach but, it's hard to find ""the bottom"" so to speak. There's just so many dependencies, if you try to understand one section fully then in turn you have to go to another section that it calls and so on and so forth.

**That Manga SDE Intern:** \~$52 an hour (not negotiable), 12 weeks long, Greater Seattle Area, \~$2400 per month housing stipend, free bananas.

Pros: Manga/big tech name recognition. Likely to work on technology that is more widely used within the industry.

Cons: No team matching process, potential cultural problems. No idea what I will be working on.

**Akuna Python Dev Intern:** \~$65 an hour (in the process of negotiating), 10 weeks long (also negotiatiable to 12 weeks), Chicago, corporate housing, somewhat more perks (gym, snacks etc).

Pros: Potentially makes it easier to break into SWE @ quants/financial firms? Much clearer idea of what I would be working on. Smaller intern cohort.

**Stanford Pros:**

Higher ranked program

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional background:**

My goal is to get into a tech company, and I want a degree from a school that will make it easy to secure interviews. 

I have done over 500 leetcode problems and am confident I can pass interviews if given a shot, but it’s been a struggle getting interviews. 

So far I have 1 SWE internship at a big defense company, and 1 SWE internship at a no-name retail company. Undergrad was in Math, not in CS."

csMajors,Final year student getting no interviews,1667131822," I'm a final-year student studying computer science and struggling to get interviews. I also have 9 months of work experience in ABAP, Fiori and React. I resigned from my current company because it was a small start-up and I didn't like the non-existent management and no opportunity to grow. I also didn't like the tech stack.

For 3 weeks, I applied to over 30 jobs, and I got only 7 rejections and no responses from others which I take as a rejection considering it's been 3 weeks since I applied to them. I think that the work experience it's a bit of useless since I apply to fullstack or backend in C#, Node and React.

What am I doing wrong? (I think that 30 apps is a resonable number to get at least one interview, considering that I'm from Romania, where there are not a lot of jobs like in the US).

csMajors,Couldn't get an offer because I'm too smart,1667131502," 

Ugh.  After solving all the LeetCode hard problems in Go, Rust, JS, and C I  finally landed an interview with a FAANG. It went really well. I found  several logic errors in the coding challenge they gave me, they seemed  to appreciate that except for one guy in the interview who was visibly  annoyed with me. The other people in the interview genuinely appreciated  the suggestions I offered. At least I thought so. So, after all this  work, they brought me to their headquarters. I spent a whole day meeting  people and answering questions. They even let me see a secret project  they were working on. They want to deliver packages in partnership with  garbage trucks: it's really pretty smart because those trucks go all  over town and they have lots of unused space. Anyway, they showed me  this secret project and I made a few suggestions like applying a  modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm parallelized  along orthogonal hypercubes. I demonstrated how they could avoid the  duplicate semaphore induction problem while delivering even more  packages than they initially projected. It was great.

Well,  after all that, they never even made me an offer. They just sent me a  generic rejection letter. I asked my recruiter for feedback. She said I  was too smart. Too smart? How can that be? She said I made all the other  developers feel inferior and they didn't want to work with me because of that. And one of the interviewers said I had bad breath, but I think I  can sue them for illegal discrimination on that. I'll keep everyone posted."

* Could live in SF and commute to San Mateo. I heard SF is a much better city for young people. 

Apple (Santa Clara):

* My personal dream company as a kid. Apple Park seems really cool. 
* Working with C++ video processing pipeline for AR/VR. I don't know systems programming that well, so this would be a good learning experience.

My thinking is: it seems rlly difficult to get to this interview point.

Fidelity is in Durham, NC  
Bank of America is in Charlotte, NC.

I've never touched leetCode and i have less than a year of internship experience due to world events, Its all about showing that you do have some practical skills, are approachable, can communicate, and are willing and able to learn. I don't go to a major big name school either.

I applying to new grab 2023 positions (may graduation) and have been applying to all sectors, defense, financial, you name it I've sent an application. I've been ghosted, rejected based on resume more times than i can count, interviews and rejected, failed skill assessments the works. Its all about finding the right fit for you.

The JP Morgan Chase offer comes from a failed skill assessment, a horrible technical interview but one of the best feeling behavioral / attitude interviews I've ever done. 

I'm not allowed to talk much about my internship due to the nature of the work but it is with a very large company working with a little older code base but its practical agile SWD experience. I work primarily in C/C++ and python with only academic Java experience (this seems to be the main thing holding be back from other places).

I have just transferred to another more reputable university overseas to complete my second and final year. There has been a huge giant step in terms of the difficulty of the course. I am having trouble catching up with the lectures and having a hard time completing my exercises.

I feel that I am stuck at a dead end and this has taken a toll on my mental well-being.

csMajors,Plaid vs Uber vs Atlassian (SWE intern),1667055592,"Hi! I was lucky enough to receive offers from Plaid, Uber, and Atlassian, and I need to make a decision soon.

This also might be my last internship, so whether this company is good to return to as a new grad is an important factor.

csMajors,Discrete Math struggles,1667053631,"Hello everyone,

I am a second year CS student currently taking Discrete Math along with some other CS courses and calc 3. 

I know that Discrete Math will be the class I will likely perform the worst in, even though I am planning to spend a few hours every day on this class until finals. We are learning about combinatorics and to be honest I am a little confused, but I think I can grasp certain topics within the chapter. To be honest though my main worry is writing proofs for exams and assignments. I have never been exposed to proof writing before this class, so this new logical way of thinking will take some getting used to for me. I feel like I get stuck on the proofs pretty quickly, and I really don’t want to just search the answer up. I also feel like sometimes Im in class and the professor writes the steps to prove a theorem in class, and I think, “how did he know to go from step A to B? I would have never ever thought of that.” 

I am planning to try to do hopefully some practice every evening, writing a few proofs or at least trying to tackle them. Any advice is welcome, I really don’t want to take it again next semester with a prof who is infamous for being extremely difficult and failing many students. Thanks."

csMajors,"I really enjoy my classes, but my internship made me really worried about my future",1667013557,"CS is my third major. It is the one I wanted to do originally, but I thought I was too dumb. Now I have transferred to a cheaper school with a good CS program that I can commute to since I will be graduating late. My favorite class currently is data structures and I love the professor. I love my computer organization + assembly class as well, also taught by a great professor. I am taking an SQL class which is a lot harder than I thought, but overall it feels great to solve problems whether it be circuitry, assembly, C++, or SQL (my other classes are not very difficult or noteworthy)

Still. I had an internship over the summer and I hated it. You would think I would have enjoyed it so much. I was making $15 an hour, working for a respected on the rise company, it was remote. The thing is I just hated it so much. I was isolated from the other interns doing web development. I was using JS, angularjs (not angular, literally angularJS), C#, html, CSS. In theory I should have enjoyed it so much. The thing is the vibes were terrible despite everyone being very nice. I did not put forth the greatest effort as I did not really enjoy the work I was doing. For some reason angularJS was very hard for me to figure out. To give credit to myself they said I exceeded expectations and invited me back, but I declined.

My favorite part was probably making a working email form.

After my internship I dread the future. I can't imagine having to deal with clients, having to be on tight deadlines, having a manger and dev team to constantly report to. I don't know what I would do if I can't figure something out. I want my job to be stress-free

That being said, I guess this is more of a rant post, but has anyone shared similar feelings? Loving their classes, but hating the future? If I had a choice I would do something relating to CS and fish, as I am an aquarist and I love doing that. Is there a pathway for mixing CS and research of nature? Specifically of the aquatic kind?

Now I am on the search for another internship, and that is something I would really enjoy."

For example: a project that has a GUI application and lets users chat with each other over a network and can support port forwarding. Would you simply name it 'Network Chat Application' or something a bit less blatant and catchy like 'SocketTalk'?

If you made a social media website would you simply just title it 'Social Media App' or would you give it a unique name?"

I’m currently in the beginning of my computer science classes, and one of my current classes is a cybersecurity 101 class and requires basic knowledge in UNIX/LINUX systems and I have zero knowledge about that subject at all. 
For context, I had to to drop a class and add a new one in order to fulfill the requirement of having full time credit hours. I asked my advisor what class I should take after giving him my schedule, and he recommended
this cybersecurity class and said while it doesn’t count towards my major it is a good subject to learn about and will fulfill all my needs. So I enrolled in the class. I was not able to find out I needed to know about UNIX/LINUX systems until the class started because the UNIX class isn’t set as an actual prerequisite for the class even though it seems like I need to know it. I can’t drop the class and get a W and also lose financial aid so that is not an option. Below I will give an example of a question so you can gauge what I’m dealing with.

TL;DR:

Just starting my comp sci degree. Advisor scheduled a class that I need to know some level of UNIX to solve some problems without telling me I needed to. Can’t drop the class, will lose money and fail. Where can I start to at least learn the bare minimum to be in this class?

Overall, I get little support from my school programs and professors, so I want to be proactive about my future. My programming course has taught me the very basics in C++ such as functions, loops, branches, and arrays/vectors. It's all been coming to me fairly quickly and I can usually solve labs in class without too many problems. (though I use internet resources to get ideas of how to solve problems) 

I'm unsure how to translate these skills into something that I can put on a resume or how to even begin to start the process of bettering myself. All the labs that I have done are through an imbedded coding tool via ZyBooks, so I feel like I don't really quite know where to go from here.

I grew up my first 10 years of my life in America before moving to Israel. When I graduated high school, without going into to much detail, I joined a pretty reputable signal intelligence unit in the IDF that involved a lot of IT and programming skills for 3 years. 

I am now on the verge of leaving, and I have an offer to work as a Security Consultant at one of the top cybersecurity companies in Israel, in addition to several offers at other firms (one is FAANG, but it isn't an SWE role, more like an IT-related security role). 

My main issue with these roles, though, is that they aren't directly related to what I want to do. I want to be a software engineer - most of these roles, while still technical, are definitely closer to the IT/IT-security side than the actual programming and software development side.

At the same time, I am applying to several different universities in both Israel and the United States. With my test scores + grades in high school + military service in the IDF (not to mention the fact that I'm not an international student as I am a US citizen), I am confident that I can get into pretty good universities in computer science in both countries.

So, my question is, what kind of career path should I take. I see three options:

1) Forget college. Go directly into the work force as a security consultant.

2) Forget work. Go directly into college - either in Israel or America.

3) A combination of both - my friends suggested I work as a Security Consultant for a few years before going to college.

Any ideas on what I should do?"
csMajors,Got an internship offer but I'm scared it'll be rescinded over a misunderstanding (my fault),1666987012,"Okay Im aware that I sound dumb here but please hear me out. 

Some background: 
I go to a school with a 12 month coop program and this extends my degree by one year. So I'm in third year but I'm class of 2025.  Because I've already registered a coop in January, I literally could not graduate earlier than May 2025. 

What happened:

A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn about a job with Microsoft, it's EXPLORE intern position. Now, I had never heard of it and she said it was a cool opportunity to explore both SWE and PM and for people graduating from 2025 to 2026. I messaged one person from my school on LinkedIn and she said that most interns come back as either regular SWE or PM the summer after and I assumed that's why they care about grad date. I was excited because I love the idea and applied. I entered all my info truthfully, that I started school in 2020 and will graduate in 2025 and was able to pass both rounds and get an offer. Yay! 

But here's the thing, after I joined the msft discord I realized that most people there don't understand the idea of coop (it's not a gap year, I would be registered as a full time student) because it's a Canadian thing? And they told me that I should be wary because they are doing a background check and may think I was dishonest because I'm not a second year student. I should state that I literally spoke 1:1 with a (FB) recruiter and told them I'm in third year BUT graduating in 2025 and he later recommended Facebook university to me bc he just cares about grad date. Also my school would verify my expected grad date as 2025. I always state 2025 because most companies want to know when you can come back as a full time new grad, so it's an honest answer. So I made some assumptions but yeah, the idiocy was not clarifying sooner (tbh I didn't think I'd even get to the first round) 


Now I feel like an idiot and I am very strongly thinking of messaging my recruiter explaining this situation because the last thing I want is to fail a background check in like March and then have no summer coop. I do not wish to be dishonest, but I also genuinely thought that if a recruiter is in my DMs and I never lied on my application or during my interview (there are Literally 2 summer internships on my resume that I spoke about at length???) that I should be ok. I have no worries about the rest of my background check, my GPA and all jobs are real and paid positions. 

Basically I'm pretty bummed but if I'm going to get the offer rescinded I'd rather know now so I can accept other roles. 

What would y'all do? I know I'm in a unique situation but I feel like I made a mistake at *least* by not clarifying earlier. I swear I've been so overwhelmed with applying to over 200 jobs, 20+ interviews this past month, 6 classes and a part time job. I genuinely didn't think too much about it. Ugh."

csMajors,PWC Internship Query,1666980457,"Hey everyone,

I'm a CS major student, and I got an internship offer at PWC for the Cybersecurity Team for Consulting.

This will be my second internship and will pay me much more than my previous SWE internship.

However, I wanted to know whether there will be technical work to do if I want to as I want to make sure that I still do coding/programming. Also, will this be a good thing or an obstruction for me if I apply for tech, especially for SWE or MLE(Machine Learning Engineer roles, in the future especially for FAANG? Has anyone personally gone from consulting like job to a tech job again, especially FAANG, in the future?

Also, please share your overall experience if you were there as an intern and especially for this type of role and what was your day like.

Thanks in advance!"

csMajors,I GOT A JOB!!!!,1666978803,"I was a pre-med student who switched to math&amp;cs my junior year without any coding experience. I didn’t have time to get internships because I prioritized graduating on time over experience (I can’t afford to pay 80k in tuition 😔). I constantly compared myself with my peers who had internships, and felt myself spiraling. After spending the summer grinding leetcode, studying data structures and algorithms, and sending 100+ applications, I finally got ONE yes! On cloud 9 right now. This is a motivational post to all my people who didn’t have internships/or started their tech career “late”. It’s never too late! Don’t give up hope! I believe in you :)"

csMajors,MSFT Internship: What to focus on in interviews (spoiler alert: it's not just about leetcode),1666978239,"To get right to the point: in technical interviews, there is so much more to them than knowing how to solve the leetcode-style questions they inevitably ask you. In fact, I might argue that your general attitude and vibes you give off with the interviewer are more important. Being specific: I just completed two final-round technical interviews with Microsoft this past Monday. I won't specify the questions I got (that would make my entire argument here pointless), but there were \~10 high-level technical questions in the first one, and then 20 mins at the end to do an LC medium. I didn't solve the question or optimize my solution. Next interview, BAM, 5 OOP questions I literally knew nothing about. But I was candid about being clueless and we both were laughing and vibing about it. Then he asked the LC Medium final question, which I literally blanked on. Legit, he held my hand through 20 mins of stumbling through the code. I immediately was like, I'm fucked. I should've prepped more. I see people on this sub saying the interviews are easy but hard for me. I'm incompetent. The works. But I kept my cool, and after our allotted time, we talked for 15 mins about what we both enjoy about being in an office and the interactions that come with it, as well as why he likes Microsoft, etc. I left the interview feeling awful in that I failed it, but good in that I vibed with the interviewer. I ended up getting accepted yesterday, and I was genuinely shocked. Not here to brag at all, but if I didn't get it, my entire argument would be false anyhow. My entire point is, relax, you won't be able to memorize the 2,000+ LC problems, or know all the patterns for every data structure perfectly, you just won't. And even if you do, it's not about just knocking the problem out of the park. Connecting with the interviewer is super important, and as I learned, more important, than solving the technicals correctly. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long time lurker of this sub. Am a current junior at a non-top CS school w/ one fintech f500 internship last summer. If I can do it, anyone can do it. Have faith, STOP comparing yourself to these fucks on here humble bragging about ""omg, i dont know what to choose between Two Sigma and Jane Street, plz help"".

I was told that I stand no chance as a freshman, I was rejected from all the freshmen specific programs so, I decided to get at least an unpaid internship. Applied to around \~20 on angel list, got a message to schedule an interview; I took it. Day of the interview comes, no show from interviewer. I'm sitting there, in the room, fucking speechless, no other way to describe it. So, I said fuck it, went on Indeed, and started browsing internships. On around the 2nd page, I saw rainforest; I applied. And around a week later, at the dentist office, I received the email for the OA. You have no idea how hyped I was. It's indescribable. For the next \~2 months, non-stop, I was grinding leetcode. Got to the interview, passed it.

**Anger** 

It was around December, so I stopped grinding leetcode completely. I expected that I'd pick it back up closer to the recruiting season in April/May. And I didn't. I tried to do it while I was doing the internship, couldn't do it. I had immense guilt for wasting so much time. Even though I did well at the internship and got the return offer.

 **Bargaining** 

End of October, still not much leetcode progress. Majority of people outside of this sub would totally be cool with it. Majority of people in this sub would probably not be. Do I care? Not really. Maybe I just adapted the same mentality. I can see myself achieving much greater things, like the plan described in the beginning. Is rainforest bad? No. $10k a month for an intern? Fully remote? Amazing team? Sign me up. 

**Depression** 

What's the point of this post? It's just me feeling guilty about my choices. I do well in classes, go to the gym, play soccer, and video games. Do I enjoy doing those things? Yes. Do I feel insane guilt every day because I have more potential that I'm not realizing? Also, yes. I spend too much time on video games; or so I think. In reality though, I'm in good shape, with good grades, and have a good social circle. Maybe I'm just trying to convince myself. I don't know.  

I understand that I have a shit load of time before the next recruiting cycle. And I hope it will be a lot better than this one. I understand that I don't have to grind leetcode like a maniac every day, just 1 hour a day is enough. I could replace 1 hour of video games with leetcode, but I just don't. I'm 19 years old ffs. Why can't I do what I think I should do? Some day I feel motivated and promise myself that I will stay consistent. Some days, like today, I just feel like a bitch. 

I rationalize by saying that I have a great team, great pay, great conditions for work. But the immense guilt of spending free time just eats me from the outside like something else. 

Anyone else? Thoughts? How do you deal with it? Any advice?"

I did a CodeSignal yesterday and got 200/300 on question 4 (failed hidden test cases). I had the same question as the question 4 in this post: [https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1019465/quora-new-grad-oa-2021](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/1019465/quora-new-grad-oa-2021). 

My naive solution was to have an array of created rectangles, then check if the current rectangle fits in all of them. Of course, this solution was met with TLE. 

Optimization I thought of what that we only need to keep track of two created rectangles: one with the minimum length seen so far and one with the minimum width seen so far. We compare the current rectangle with these two rectangles only.

However, still failed some hidden test cases, so I am wondering why my solution is faulty / what the optimal solution to this question actually is."

So I'm a sophomore and just got/will be getting an offer to be a SWE Intern at Mastercard for the summer.

Company A: Seattle + $2400/month housing stipend 


More context: 
I’m really grateful to be in this position, I’m just confused on where to go. I’m a 2nd year with a lot of credits who was planning on graduating in 3, but now thinking 3.5, so would not reneging + mentioning a grad yr extension to Atlassian + keeping me on file for the future sound okay? 

My ideal scenario would be to move Atlassian during the school year, but I didn’t ask them yet since that might look bad and don’t know if it’s even allowed. 

I know Company A has Fall internships AND reneging is usually fine but I still don’t feel comfortable with the idea of reneging, especially in this economy or if I end up blacklisted for a couple years or something etc.

I’m an current sophomore who got accepted to participate in JPMorgan’s Code for Good Hackathon at Columbus for the 2023 software engineering internship.

I have participated in 3 hackathons online. However, CFG is the first hackathon that I am participating in person and working for a full 24 hours. Because of these facts, I thought that it would be great if I can get some advice from people that are familiar or participated in CFG. 

I have heard that JPMorgan considers the CFG hackathon as a final round for their software engineering internship. Because of this, I was curious of what my odds are of receiving an offer from JPMorgan after participating in Code for Good. Do they send out offers to most of the people that have participated in CFG?

Are there people who received an offer for an internship/full time after conducting CFG?

Also, after conducting the code for good hackathon, are there additional steps or interviews for the internship or do they just send out offers? If so how long do they take to get back with the offer?

Lastly, are there any tips and tricks for success while participating in code for good? Are there any stacks and programming languages that I should learn?(I am familiar with HTML/CSS Java and Python and conducted a couple projects on them)

csMajors,Taking a break for a semester. How to make the most out of it?,1666879725,"If anyone doesn’t remember, I posted not too long ago about how this major made me violently abuse myself and lose everything I love.

I sobered up and made the decision to stick to CS, but I NEED a semester or year break, so I was wondering what I should optimally do to refine my programming skills during this (any price) I came out to my dad that I was suicidal and after that he said that he would support me however long it takes as long as I went to grad school

My main motivation for this is that all the grade A students in my class are kids that have known the material already. I’m hoping it’ll make me go from a 30% student to maybe a 70%.

Tl;dr what programs (any price, preferably a semester or less) can I sign up for that will most optimally boost my core programming skills? Right now I’m taking (rather failing) data structures"

I am currently deciding on my master thesis, enrolled in Computer Science focusing on Big Data and AI. Based out of Berlin, Germany.

I use Python as my scripting language, versed with Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Seaborn, matplotlib, Understand machine learning models in theory and regression and classification models in practice. I also have basic understanding of DB and can use SQL in practice.

I still haven't found a field that I really want to work in. Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is interesting as I had done a mini project earlier. Given the time frame, I have to submit a thesis proposal in 2 weeks. I am researching and reading up on papers but I would like to work on my Master thesis with a company as I want to be exposed to real work environment as well. I lack guidance and direction, and working under someone would not only be beneficial for me, but would also give me a second supervisor that my University mandates.

* bloomberg has really robust intern program — corporate housing, broadway shows w interns, etc. datadog also has many interns and friendly intern culture. plaid does not seem to have as many, and is in sf which is a less social city 
* but plaid having less interns means higher likelihood of return offer 
* datadog seems like a great work environment with a p valuable service 
* plaid seems to be a cool product tho, and likely brings most resume value?

I'm not going to be living on campus (at-home for awhile), and I'm about 25 minutes away from college. Not a bad drive, but I know doing that possibly multiple times a day will get to me. My question is, will I be okay with a degree in software engineering? I know people like to talk about computer science in a higher regard. My dream goal would be working in game development, or somewhere like Google.  


Overall, I know I'd be much happier mentally being able to do online courses. But if a degree in computer science will help me significantly with getting those dream jobs, I am willing to go in-person. They are both very difficult majors so if I'm going to commit to it, I'd like to put my effort into something with the best outcome."

One of the best things about working in a startup environment, the Exposure was huge. Compared to other college mates. I have worked on various tech stacks and have experience on different things. 

This is also concerning for me. Cause if I have worked on a particular piece. I can tell I’m good at it. Right now, I know bits and pieces of everything and as a whole I feel like an imposter. 

Predominately worked on JS (both front end and backend), different external services (Airflow, Apache Kafka, AWS Services, Azure Services, Rollbar, Payment gateways), Devops as well. (Knows k8s, Docker, Terraform). Angular, Flutter, Android, Java and so on. To put it a short summary, if a business idea is put in front of me. I can build an MVP with the knowledge I have. 

I have worked as Technical tutor as well, teaching latest technology to post grad students while working. Mostly clean code, design pattern, infrastructure as service. 

After working for 3 years. I find it was not exciting and pursing masters in CS. One more semester to go with it, the things I wanna to ask. 

- Should I grind Leetcode and be so strong on the DSA for cracking the coding interview? I’m bit skeptical about this, back of my head “this is bullshit. You will not use a Directed Acyclic Graph cause we have got libraries.” I suck it DSA and grinding will put me back on track. 

- Should I focus more on the system design and react, js projects for the interview to assess my skills. (I feel like I’m restricting myself with the languages I know and showcase only a lil.)

csMajors,Am I a good fit for a CS degree?,1666837987,"
So I want to go into CS in college since I liked it in the one class I had and obviously because of the perks of getting a CS degree when looking for work. As I’ve said I’ve only taken one class that was web dev in HTML and I liked it a lot. I’m also very good in math/stats/physics, in APs for those and I also really like those classes.

I often hear that CS as a high drop out rate and it’s partially because people like the idea of the degree but not the actual work.

I was wondering if anyone that took CS in college can tell me if they think I can be a good fit or if I don’t have enough experience to know if I like it or not and perhaps I’m just attracted to the degree for the reputation and salary.

csMajors,"Graduate early, double major, or go for a masters?",1666830836,"So basically I’m a freshman at a public state college. I came in with so many AP credit hours from high school that after this current semester I will already have 53 hours completed. I’m currently on track to get a BS in software engineering. I talked to my advisor recently and it appears that I could graduate in about two years if I wanted. 

However, my “problem” is that I really don’t want to leave college. I’m enjoying my time here and my long time girlfriend goes here too and will be for the next four years. I also have a full ride scholarship that comes with stipend so if I graduated early I would be throwing away free money that is going towards my education. So now it appears that if I want to stay at college for a normal amount of time I would have to either pick up a double major or go for an early entry masters program and complete that along with my bachelors in four years. 

My plan was always to get a degree, go work for a large FANG or F500 company and then pursue an MBA so I could move up into management type roles. With that in mind, I’m split between double majoring in Software Engineering and Finance, Software Engineering and Math (I’ve heard that math is more useful for finance than finance actually is), or just going for a Masters in Computer Science (which would probably be a lot of work). 
I’ve barely been a college for a full semester so I still don’t really know what classes I enjoy the most yet but it feels like I’m having to make important decisions so soon  because of how far along I already am credit wise. I’m also scared that if I go for a double major I would end up struggling in the upper level courses and hurt my GPA since I don’t have prerequisites to pad it. So yeah…

I’m really kind of lost. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I’ve been doing The Odin Project so I only know the basics, but now I’m worried that I’m going to be entering it and bringing the team down. I’m only going because I want to learn and meet new people (I’m trying to improve my social skills cuz I am very anti-social) and it doesn’t matter if I get a job offer or not. 

My programming skills are not great (I would say beginner level) even though I’m in my final year of Uni. I know it’s my fault for not trying to improve over the course, but I’ve recently started to change that because I got worried about my future. I’ve made very simple projects and hoping that by doing The Odin Project, I could understand the basics of web dev and create some projects.

csMajors,Sankey chart of my SWE new grad summer 2023 experience,1666800815,"hey y'all!

i'm very lucky enough to be done with my job search this year and wanted to share my experience w/ a sankey chart! first time really recruiting actively, was open to applying to pretty much any company as a result.

about me

* Started applying in August
* T20 school, not for CS
* US Citizen
* 2 prior internships, 1 FAANG, no return offer

[Sankey Chart](https://imgur.com/a/D7SYN9E)

my thoughts on the process, most of it has already been said but thought i'd share

* it really does suck this year, felt pretty much impossible to get a response from well-known tech companies. my mood was full of ups and downs and even if things were going well it's really easy to feel doomed after every reject/ghost
* of the final rounds I made, less than half were from online apps
   * 2 from linkedin recruiters
   * 4 from my career fair
   * 4 from online applications
* god bless my career fair, saved my doomer mood and was key to getting interviews
   * only ghosted by 6/15 companies I talked to
   * found and signed with my future company that I'd never heard of prior
* online apps are a pure numbers game, even with a good resume. personally i used the simplify extension to make the process less mind-numbing 
* applying and interviewing ASAP was better than waiting until i was more prepared, nothing beats actual interview experience for preparation
* leetcode diminishing returns are real, I solved \~180 total but didn't feel like it was necessary past the grind75. the easier leetcode is for you, the less you should focus on it
   * looking on glassdoor/reddit/discord for what a company's interview questions are like was the best way to prep for me
* interviews get so much easier with practice, both technically and mentally. I found I had the best performance when I didn't care about the outcome at all
   * speaking on non technical things in behavioral's I think really helps to vibe with your interviewer and spark interest in you
* there is absolutely no shame in failing an interview, it's always a learning process and dwelling on it  hurt me long term. no particular company is a must over the hundreds that are hiring
   * getting rejected after a final interview that seems to goes well will always hurt tho :((
   * i think this is in part due to really selective companies needing more than just passing all the technicals, they need to like you in particular which comes a lot through your behavioral interview and resume
* smaller companies often have room for salary negotiation, especially with competing offers

i think that's it from me, there is still so much time left for us new grads next summer, so don't lose hope! happy to answer any questions."

On my exams, he docked marks because I didn’t have as many functions as states in my state diagram design. At first, I didn’t think this made any sense, but going back on his material it is obvious to me that he thinks flow charts and state diagrams are the same thing.

I’ve had issues with this instructor before, where he asked a non-sense  multiple choice question about exceptions where all the answers were wrong except for one general answer and I lost marks because I wasn’t specific enough.

Here’s the thing, I’m just finishing my bachelors part time. I already have a professional career in the field. I don’t care what mark I get in this course except for the fact that I pass.

But still, it pisses me off how confidently wrong he is. So I was thinking about writing an email to him explaining the differences, but I also feel like this is a waste of time because it is unlikely to resolve in any positive outcome for me.

csMajors,Is my CS degree badly structured or am I just stupid?,1666786386,"We had assembly and proofs in our first semester. We were expected to being able to work with command consoles and Github despite the degree being advertised as being for complete beginners. 

We have bi-weekly labs for OOP and every other subject, but no ""office hours"" like in America(?) where you get some help. You're just expected to bring the result back 100% correct everytime or you won't be admitted to the exam at the end of the semester.

When I told my OOP professor that it was extremely difficult for me to master new concepts in programming within a week (as I had no prior programming experience), his response was ""you can always ask a classmate with more experience"". (You can guess how that looks when you're the only girl in your course.) 

I dedicate my entire time to my degree but that's not enough. I just needs lots of time and practice for new topics to make sense in my head. I'm so worried about completing the labs on time that I don't even have the time to focus on programming itself. 

At this point everyone else in my degree is 25-30yo men who have lots of experience in programming. I'm the only kid fresh out of highschool who's still enrolled. Am I simply too stupid for this degree?"

Second of all, the courses taught. Here, curses that we have are web development, IoT, Linux, data bases etc. But it seems that in the USA there is more pressure on math, algorithms and data structures?

csMajors,I don’t fit in with the people in my major?,1666772076," Basically, I’m in college, studying Humanities but I feel like I don’t fit well with others in my major. Like this semester I have two major specific classes where everyone is the same major as me and I have zero friends in both. On the other hand, I usually have no problems making friends in my other classes. I talk to people in my major specific classes too but we just never click. I thought it’d be easier to become friends when we have something in common. But no. Out of all of my friends in college, I don’t have one who’s my major - and my college only offers around 8 majors / programs. I don’t know what it is. I mean I’m not super passionate nor interested in what I’m studying so maybe the major isn’t right for me? Idk tho.

But everyone in my major dresses differently than me, acts differently, has different interests &amp; opinions,… I don’t get it. &amp; I’m worried bc I’m just gonna have more and more major focused classes in the future once I’m done with all of my general education classes.

I switched into CS last semester so I already feel so behind. And it’s not looking good for this year. 

I’ve heard back about a tech writing internship with a reputable tech company. I’m not in the interview process with any other company (just a bunch of OAs, rejections, ghosting, and potential lower-tier offers). This seems to be my only way in, but my friends think it’s going to pigeonhole me into tech writing. I don’t want to do it long term - pay is significantly worse and I’d rather code than write for a living. Should I seriously consider the tech writing position or keep applying to SWE internships?

I’m so tired, genuinely. I already regret so many choices that I’ve made in the past few years (i.e. switching so late and not trying for internships earlier). It’s getting harder to get out of bed which I know is so dramatic but things are looking dire fr. Just looking for advice I guess ://"

csMajors,Bloomberg Vs. Palantir FDE,1666746842,"Yo yo, would love some opinions out here. Currently deciding between job offers for full time as a SWE at Bloomberg or a Forward Deployed Engineer ad Palantir. **Both in NYC, assume equal pay.** 

**My take on Bloomberg**: I interned at BB and had a great experience. My team was def dealing with some tech debt but  I was working on a pretty cool and impactful project. I'd be very happy going back full time. I think there is a great opportunity to explore different teams at Bloomberg before I get matched to one and I could find something I am interested in. I'd learn some good SWE and tech skills, and hopefully work to get some product/business exposure too, and have the ability to move around within the company.

**My take on Palantir**: This place is so different in so many ways. To start they have different cultures, and Palantir felt more social and younger (with more turnover). As a forward deployed engineer I would work very closely with customers (which I would enjoy)  and work on *""impactful""* projects (so they say). That being said the tech work is lacking as an FDE and seems to be mainly data engineering (which I have never done and have no clue if I would like it).

**Overall**: I think Palantir could teach me some valuable soft skills with problem solving and working with customers, along with picking up things on the fly (breadth), where Bloomberg will teach me a lot of core engineering skills (depth) which I have always wanted. I've been spinning in circles thinking that Bloomberg is the right choice to start my career, but I keep coming back to this surface level excitement at Palantir and the thought of missing out on something different/new/exciting. It also feels like Palantir is more unique and if I wanted to leave and go to SWE I could, where it may be harder to get back into Palantir once I turn it down.

Also, generally I see myself eventually moving on from straight engineering to the business side, but I have no idea when or what role that would be in

csMajors,Is there any decent online schools for Computer Science?,1666735016,"Hello everyone,



I am a Computer Science major at a community college. However, I am also an adult [not sure if that's the right word, sorry], meaning I have my own place, have a partner I live with, have a job I like, have friends in the area and have good doctors. I really like the area I live in. This is all to say that I'd prefer not to move, and that moving would be uprooting my entire life.



This semester I am applying to 4-year universities. I have applied to a few of the UCs, including UC Berkeley, which I am hoping to be able to attend next year. Now, going to UC Berkeley would be great, it would give me a bunch of great opportunities. But it would also involve uprooting my entire life to move there.




Which is why I am wondering: is there any decent online schools for Computer Science?"

csMajors,Does this sound like too heavy of a courseload?,1666730259,"CS is my third major, and this is the one I am sticking to (both out of interest and necessity since I am going to be 23 when this semester is over, I can't stay in school much longer)

I can graduate in two semesters, but that will require me taking 3 300 level electives, and all of the 300 level core course requirements over those two semesters. With how this semester is starting to feel, I am not sure if I will be able to do that. I am starting to struggle in SQL programming for crying out loud.

I am doing well overall, I have a 3.8 GPA, I got a 100 on my data structures mid term, and I was mostly coasting through, but these last couple of weeks have made me realize I basically need to dedicate my soul to studying if I want to continue doing well.

The classes I will be most likely taking next semester are... Programming languages, operating systems, linear algebra, computer networks (elective), and the first of two classes in our capstone, which is called software engineering 1, it seems like this will be designing a project and then software engineering 2 is implementing the project. I really worry about this because I don't want to be the weak link in my group. I am also considering taking a class called ""three dimensional game development"" instead of the network class because it sounds fun, but I imagine it will be difficult.

Does this sound like it will be too much? I have to take the programming languages and operating systems classes since they are only offered in spring. I am not sure about software engineering 1.

I am not sure if I should try to convince my parents to let me take an extra semester so I don't fail any classes, but maybe I can do it, I want to know what others think as I am not sure what these classes entail.

Now back to trying to complete projects that I am not sure I will be able to finish"

I started applying in early September and I've applied to at least 150 co-ops, but I've heard back from less than 10. Did I start applying too late?

I am getting desperate as I will surely be unemployed by January, so would it be advisable to accept an offer from this company or should I just keep looking? On one hand, the economy might get even worse and I’ve heard the hiring freeze will last until 2024 at the very least.

csMajors,Workday Internship Applications ‘Skills’ section importance experiment,1666684194,"So I’m at the point where filling out these applications is getting pretty monotonous and boring (100+) and I’m pretty content with my internship search.

One thing they all have in common though is that they use Workday for processing applications and I realized I’ve never been filling out the ‘Skills’ section on the Worksday Application forms. Maybe this holds some value? I mean I can assume it probably does, but I was wondering if anyones found luck by using  certain keywords from the specific job description or just stuff from your resume. 

I’m just gonna make a massive list of every keyword I see and post it in the skill section from now on and see if it gets me anywhere since you upload paragraphs in that sucker lol. Would it most likely look weird if a real person saw it? Yes but who cares.

csMajors,Why is no one talking about research or graduate degrees?,1666679819,"Research is probably not for everyone, but it is by no mean a bad choice. You get to work on truly interesting stuff than writing config files and apis. It opens up more doors for the future, as undergrads are usually not qualified for machine learning/computer vision positions. Some of the smartest friends I know are doing research right now.

Sure, research has its problems. It’s grindy, ascetic, I understand, but I don’t see any post regarding professional masters either. Personally, I think it’s a great way to learn something more advanced. I love computer graphics, animation, and simulation, and I’m looking forward to starting a part time professional master degree to learn more about those topics. Btw, more than half of my team holds a graduate degrees, so is my roommate’s team at Faang.

As someone who became a CS major because of my interest in engineering, I’m shocked by the fact that literally every single person on this sub is talking about grinding leetcode and chasing high TC. Is it just me or is no one on this sub actually interested in computer science anymore? No one interested in learning more advanced computer science concepts? No one interested in pushing the boundary of what CS is capable of?"

In other words, I just feel lucky and safe, but not really like ""I've made it."" These companies are similar in prestige imo, and the pays are pretty much in the vicinity, so I'm having a hard time choosing between orange &amp; apple. I have a 70% frontend - 30% backend skillset, but I want to get more into backend. Whichever has a more exciting backend architecture &amp; opportunity to learn will rank higher on my list.

I do have my thoughts on this, but curious to hear how y'all would choose.

I was able to land an internship offer thankfully but they said it would be 40 hours and they wouldn't recommend doing school at the same time. I've never taken a ""gap"" year before and am pretty hesitant on doing so. I asked if I could just do the internship over the Summer instead and she said she'll get back to me very soon. If there's no Summer rotation available, I'll be looking to either take a way lesser course load in my Spring semester or just take a semester off altogether. 

This sucks because I really did want to graduate early and I'm currently 20 years old with about 2-3 years left in my degree. Do you think it's worth taking a semester off if it came down to that? I currently have 15 credit hours booked for Spring. A lot of people said in this company, they often invite interns back for more rotations and often give full-time positions if you do well enough.  

Let me know your thoughts, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

csMajors,Is there such thing as “not fit” for computer science?,1666665061,"
I’m currently a fourth year in computer science (gonna need to take way more) and I’ve failed every single one of my programming classes once, even the introduction classes. The only way I’d be able to pass on large coding projects is by combining focus drugs (caffeine, adderall, and modafinil) and at the end of the night I’d binge drink to ease the anxiety effects, but I would indeed do good on those projects. (This is after I fail everything the first time I take the class) My mom at the time had cancer, but i would feel like taking care of her was getting in the way of me passing my test cases so I would secretly ditch her and beg my dad or brother to take care of her instead while I was gone. I also broke up with my girlfriend of one year to double my self prescribed dose and pass my OOP final. I miss her so fucking much everyday it hurts. My moms okay though and recovering.

This semester I decided to take it easy and sober after I was hospitalized from combining various doses of modafinil and caffeine at the gym but I’m still failing all my cs classes. (Logic, low level, and data structures) I called suicide prevention within 3 times within the past month and they only picked up once. My dad also recently told me that he would only be proud of what I’m doing once I graduate.

I know that the general consensus for cs difficulty is to push through, but I don’t know if difficulty is supposed to rip your soul from the inside and make you give up everything you love. 

Tl;dr the only way I can graduate is through self abuse. Is the money I get from the career still worth it?"

I don’t want to say too many exact details, but with the F500 I’ll have time to do a 4 month internship where as the start-up I will have to go back to school. 

I am leaning towards F500 since I can possibly land a super nice company for the 4 month internship. The startup isn’t super well known, however their work seems interesting.

This level of elitism honestly makes me sick. 

To the people who are not passionate about CS, it's totally okay not to be passionate or even give a flying fuck about CS. If you are purely doing CS for the money, there is nothing wrong with it. DO NOT let anyone tell you otherwise. 

Guilt-tripping people based on their “passion” for CS is not only considered gatekeeping, but it is also very classist as well. It is a classic way to gaslight people into believing that we somehow NEED to be passionate about CS. Furthermore, projecting passion in CS to gatekeep people is the opium of the working class. Most of us working-class students are doing CS just for the economic incentives that come along with a degree in CS. In this economy, there is no better way to become middle-class other than majoring in CS. 

If you are passionate about CS, good for you. 

But just leave us alone.

&amp;#x200B;

I went through the first quarter of this list: [https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships](https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2023-Internships) . But again, as I said, they don't specifically target freshman. Google's also been quite a nice resource, but it always seems so incomplete. Everything else that I know has been scattered information from friends, faculty, and events.

&amp;#x200B;

I've already applied to Microsoft Explore, Google STEP, Palantir, and the other well-known stuff. What I'm looking for, is a very long list of similar programs to apply for before the wave of November and December deadlines.

csMajors,Any advice on applying or being ready for a Software Engineering Job? (I apologize for the long post).,1666589995," I currently have two certifications in Information Technology Support and Programming I, and one more semester before I graduate with two associate degrees in Cybersecurity and Programming along with three more certifications (Ethical Hacking, Cybersecurity Specialist, and Programming II) a total of two degrees and 5 certifications. This is unfortunately my second time going to school in the same field of study (due to financial and medical issues), so I've previously completed courses in Advanced Website Development (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP... I know HTML and CSS don't count lol) and Python I &amp; Python II. The languages I've been focusing on have been C++, Java, and SQL, and I've been reviewing JavaScript and Python on my own time between classes because it's been a while since I've worked with those languages. Honestly keeping or attempting to keep up with all or most of these languages have been proven pretty difficult given that I'm still a full-time student. I've been using a subscription to Codecademy along with my previous course Textbooks on the languages in my free time and I've also paid for courses on Udemy to help. Aside from software engineering I also keep up and am well focused on cybersecurity, but software engineering is where my passion is currently at. I have worked hard for where I am academically and have joined an honor society per request, have maintained a 3.0 - 4.0 GPA, and continue to be top of my classes, this upcoming spring semester I have three classes left before I graduate. Of course, studying this way strongly affects my social life, although I'm not the most social person, I moved three years ago and have yet to make any good friends or good relationships.

My greatest fear is that I will begin searching for a job and won't be knowledgeable enough to qualify for a solid position, this is why I study so hard and push myself as I do. My roommate just graduated as a lawyer and passes his bar exam and has even made comments that I even study more than him or as much as him. Of course, he doesn't know what I do but I guess he hears how passionate I am when I talk about my work/studies or tutor/aid classmates. I don't actually have an official job given that I put so much time into my studies, but I do freelance in developing and maintaining websites for local businesses and local nonprofit organizations. I have classmates and professors who either work or have retired in the field of Cyber Security and Programming who stress to me my potential and encourage me not to settle for less when it comes to looking for a job.

I live in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, tech is known to pay well where I live and I've been previously asked about being referred by a State Farm to apply as a Software Engineer. Looking upon their career page I noticed they have a Software Engineer Intern position only being offered for the Summer 2023 and require you to return to school for at least one semester after the internship, but I have graduated by then. There are other positions in Software Engineering but most are not all require me to know AWS which I honestly haven't studied yet (but now plan on taking courses on in my personal time). Is there any solid advice that I can be given, I feel like I'm really burning myself out but I am dedicated and I have a goal in mind, and I don't plan on anything getting in my way of it. So all I've come here for was advice.

I greatly appreciate anyone who reads this extremely long post and also appreciates any solid replies or comments."

I've got an offer with a company and I'm set to start after I graduate in May 2023.

My logic is that if things aren't going well for the company around May 2023 and they decide to rescind offers, I'll have already joined in January and will be ""safe"". For reference, the company is a B2B company. They're a well funded company but not public. I'd rather stay in school and graduate in May but graduating w/ a job beats graduating w/o a job everytime. If I stay in school, how big a risk am I taking? I'm pretty spooked by the hiring freezes and layoffs right now and I imagine things will only get worse."

I've heard the HM round after that can be either decomp/learning or coding (lc style) and that we would be told ahead of time which one it is. For those who made it to that point, what have you gotten? how did the difficulty level compare to before?

Feel free to recommend good safety schools, or reach schools you think I’d be competitive for. Also, it would be great if I don’t have to shell out $ for the app but that’s not a requirement.

csMajors,Having second thoughts about my CIS major - advice needed,1666570619," I'm about 2 years deep into an associates in Computer Information  Systems and I'm liking it less and less by the day. I had originally  spoken to my counselor about what degree would be best for me, and based  off of what I told her (that I like working with computers, computer  hardware, and I want to work in the IT field) and she told me CIS would  be my best bet. Now I'm looking into it more and that doesn't seem  accurate. The entirety of my schooling has been in various coding  languages (besides typical electives) and all of my future classes will  be coding and database related courses. This really really sucks for me  because over the course of my degree I have realized that computer  software is NOT my jam, and that is all this degree is about from what I  have read/learned. I want to stay in the tech field because I really  enjoy it, I know a lot about it, and I am good at it, but I can't with  software. it sucks.

csMajors,"How do you study before, during and after each lecture?",1666546591,"Hey there, I started a CS course at uni this month and my process on studying right now as someone who had very little pre-knowledge of programming has been like this:  

1) If available read/watch the lecture material prior to class, if not, try do some research on topic.  

2) Go to lecture, listen and only take notes for things that isn't mentioned on the slides (for maths I take notes during the lecture since we do a lot of stuff that isn't covered on the slides/lecture notes).

3) Go over the exercises that we're given after the lecture/ask about anything I'm confused on/whine about the lecturer being bad with my friends etc.  

4) Go through lecture notes and write shorter more concise notes on my note taking app (Notion) and make sure I understand everything.  

5) Repeat for every module each week.  

Is there anything else you guys would do? I feel like this is working for me but I'd like to hear how you guys have/are studying since I'd like to do my best to learn the most I can :).

I graduated from Coastal Carolina University in 2020 with a B.A. in National Security, and a minor in GIS (Geographic Information Sytems). 3.08 GPA. 
I live in South Carolina. However I would prefer to be out of the southeastern USA for personal reasons, but I'm not completely closed off to it.
University of South Carolina has an MS CS program and I heard it's good but I don't believe they have a sort of bridge program to help non cs majors.

Unfortunately I've realized I have a big passion for  computers and software and all they represent more or less, plus I have a special interest in game design and game development which CS would be amazing for. 

Now, I have seen some universitIes like Northeastern University with programs that accept non cs backgrounds but some of them have tuition rates in the 50,000+ range which I just don't know I can do. Others have stipulations, like you may not be a CS background but you need a good tech background. I think Georgia Tech is like this?

I guess I'd like to hear from others what 
routes they were able to take who were also from non cs backgrounds, or if anyone knows of any good MS CS programs for Non Cs majors, as there's so many universities it's hard to go through them all.

We've been together for almost 3 years. All has been great between us. We fight here and there all the time but not as bad as this time. She went in my phone and found out that I have given some of my girl friends ""Heart"" reaction. I explained to her that I am friendly and all of these girls are my friends (Even though we're not as close but still friends on social media). I spent a week to think about it and decided to have a conversation with her, telling her that I did not mean anything in those love reactions online and I've been completely loyal with her since the first day. I'm not so sure why she would end things like this since she knows that I am loyal and all. I understand her feelings in this topic but I am loyal and treat her like a queen. I put her up over everything I adore. Friends, family gatherings and especially my my family.

Honestly, I love her and want a future with her. She kept saying and thinking I want to cheat on her and that I am not loyal to her. She broke up with me saying she can't trust me anymore from what she has found and stated she's not comfortable when we're together anymore. Seriously, I never would have thought she would put this issue this way. Yes, I shouldn't have done that in the first place to cause confusion in our relationship. But honestly, is it worth breaking up from this? I'm upset and disappointed in the way she thinks and puts situations like this. 
Any advice would be much appreciated!

A while ago, I got an internship that past me would be extremely happy about, and I was definitely happy about it (for about a week). I’m a second year who recently switched my major to CS and this internship opportunity is something I never imagined I’d be able to get this early in my college career.

But recently, I’ve started to fully convince myself that the internship is not good enough and the company isn’t prestigious or high-paying enough. Right now I’m interviewing with a higher-paying and what most people would consider a much more prestigious company and all I can think about is how all of my problems will be solved if I get the internship and how sad I’ll be if I get rejected (despite already having an offer that I used to be happy with). I really think I’ll be devastated if I don’t get this internship, even though I already have an offer that I should be happy with.

For those who can relate to chasing prestige, do you feel content with your life or can you somewhat relate? I’m just wondering if I’ll ever be satisfied with my life if I just keep chasing and wanting more and I’m not really sure how to change my mindset (like the hedonic treadmill).

Nordstrom is not the first name you think of when it comes to tech but my interviewer talked about how their tech stack is very much modern which I thought would be a better experience in terms of developing my skills as a software engineer. 

The culture at Nordstrom seems to be a lot better in terms of WLB and code-base impact though JP Morgan pays more relative to COL. Not sure what to do here. I would be happy with new grad return offers from both companies. :)

For me being international, how does that work out with my Uni? Will I need to be enrolled in classes alongside my internship? I can only work through CPT I’m assuming so just curious about how that fits in.

Any sources for finding spring internships to apply for? I’m located in the New York area.

If I’m required to do coursework alongside it’s probably better to do a remote one, is that overall a good idea?

Is it not too late to still look for Spring 2023?

csMajors,Do recruiters typically give leeway on smaller mistakes in an OA?,1666466970,"I took an OA a few days ago with 3 questions. Questions were a LC Easy, Medium, Hard in that order.

The other 2 problems, I got all points for correctness and most for efficiency/speed.

Given that the overall logic in my first solution was correct and that I did well on the harder questions, do y'all think whoever reviews it will see that it was a minor mistake or will my low score from missing a bunch of testcases just get me looked over?

Also, fwiw all of my problems had a bunch of comments explaining my thinking process and how the code is supposed to work so if they review it, they should see what I was trying to do."

csMajors,2023 summer internship application results,1666432375," 

I just concluded my internship application process for summer 2023; here are the results.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Sophomore at HYPSM, double majoring in computer science and mathematics, 3.8/4 GPA. Planning to complete my requirements early and spend my fourth year doing a master’s, so my bachelor’s graduation date would be 2024.
* Experience:  
   * SWE/DS Intern at a decent tech company last summer, but I didn’t actually do very much at this internship.
   * Research in applied mathematics, no publication
   * USA Computing Olympiad Platinum qualifier

&amp;#x200B;

**Applications:** I started applying in early August. In total, I submitted around 100 applications, mostly from the PittCSC github listing, using [simplify.jobs](http://simplify.jobs/) to fill out forms quickly. Received OA or first round interview from about 25 companies. Once I received my first offer I declined some OAs and interviews because I didn’t particularly care about the company, or because I was busy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Offers:**

* Amazon SDE Intern, Boston
* Capital One TIP Intern, Chicago
* Chicago Trading QT Intern, Chicago

&amp;#x200B;

**Late Round Interviews**:

* Arrowstreet Quant Dev Intern (rejected after third round hiring manager interview)
* IMC SWE Intern (rejected after final round)
* Jane Street QT Intern (rejected after third round)
* Optiver QT Intern (rejected after 2-hour technical)
* SIG QT Intern (rejected after second round)

&amp;#x200B;

**Failed earlier round interviews:** Akuna, Belvedere, Citadel, Five Rings, HRT, several other smaller quant trading firms, a few mid-late stage machine learning startups.

&amp;#x200B;

**Reflections:**

* I mostly got interviews from quant firms and got ghosted by most FAANG-adjacent software companies. I don’t know why.
* Late round QT interviews are really hard. I need to actually prepare if I want to try again next year.
* The machine learning classes I took in school were very theoretical, and I don’t have much practical experience, and it definitely showed during MLE interviews
* I was taking a very heavy courseload this term, so scheduling interviews and finding time to do OAs was often difficult.

I declined the C1 offer already; have yet to decide between the other two."

csMajors,Can’t decide which major to choose. Help required,1666426241,"Hei lads, I’ve got a question for you all. 
The school that I go to provides two different major options which I find equally interesting: software development, or ICT  infrastructure and cloud services (the courses in the cloud major are focused on getting the the azure cert, the different AWS cert until solutions architect and DevOps engineer. )
I live in Northern Europe and honestly can’t decide which one would be the best major as a career decision, I also find that people only talk about monetary gain but I would like to know in addition to that which one is more interesting/fun once you start working on it.

Then she, someone with literally no technical background, proceeded to lecture us, students at a top ranked university, on trading and mathematical models.

I looked her up on LinkedIn and apparently she graduated at the bottom of her class in some useless humanities field at a complete trash university (over 90% acceptance rate), literally working minimum wage jobs before her current role. In short—not exactly someone qualified to question my knowledge, let alone lecture me on anything technical.

Even at the top companies, this pattern isn’t uncommon. Recruiters whose backgrounds embody mediocrity feel power trips in rejecting candidates who are clearly superior to them in every avenue of life—yet their position as a recruiter enables them to undermine this implicit hierarchy, as their own outlet for power.

Why are top companies putting their future incoming classes in the hands of people with literally no history of achievement in anything? What qualifies these people to recruit for such prestigious roles?"

I'm currently in my final year of engineering (Bachelors from India), and have almost 1 month for my 7th semester to end. I think I'm late for this thought but I've very recently had the urge to prepare for masters. (I already got a job offer in a decent-ish company). The reason for masters is because I think the problem statements I'll be working upon in the company won't be as interesting as what I'm doing in my college right now (I really like working with OS/Compilers/Networks and feel I'll be working on normal SWE projects in my company). Either way, since I'm sort of late I don't mind applying for masters next year BUT I do know that publishing a paper will surely increase my chances of getting a decent school. Here's my concern, I don't know if I have time to publish a paper now. And the reason I'm pushing this thought is because my GPA is already low (8.02/10) and I'm worried it'll reduce even further this year (I'm hoping and trying it won't tho), so I think a good paper will really help me here.

Curious to hear people's thoughts about which to take. I like that Bloomberg seems to be very recession proof, whereas Palantir's stock has not been doing well. On the other hand, Bloomberg seems a bit ""slow,"" but with good WLB, whereas Palantir seems like it has more room for growth.

csMajors,Any Cs graduate care to advise me,1666384363,"Hello, my fellow-reddit users I'm new to Reddit and thought this place would be a perfect place to get some answers!

I'm currently in my first year in Cs and quite frankly as someone who has very little knowledge in programming I'd be lying if I sat here and said it was easy. I'm currently in my 3rd week and have exams soon as well as assignments due (which I have no idea how I'll go about it). I believe I have the ability to graduate in 3 years. I'm motivated to putting in the hours to study, practice till I'm perfect at coding and further more knowledge in all aspects of these modules.

However, I'm extremely nervous, stressed and you could say I have a minor anxiety disappointing myself, family and professors to passing these exams and assignments. I'm not the brightest when it comes to Maths unfortunately but I'm not dumb either (I'd like to think so at least). Any relevant and helpful advice/tips you guys can possibly give me to motivate myself to be the best student I can be and unlock these abilities I'm holding back from having that self-belief to graduating someday.

It'd mean a lot and I appreciate everyone that interacts with this post. If you could kindly share this post as well, I'll be very thankful!

Kind regards, A student in distress"

First of all, I was assigned to Seattle office when most of my team including my mentor is located in Redmond so it's been a remote internship for me. My mentor tells me the team is usually very busy from Q3-Q4 so understandably, neither the team or my mentor seems to care about how I am doing here as an intern.

It's been 6 weeks (halfway through) since I've joined the team and the work I'm doing is not interesting at all. The team culture also feels pretty dysfunctional but at the same time, I am not motivated to push myself and frequently find myself slacking off. I've already signed an offer at a different company for next summer so I have no intention to return to AWS. 

Any tips as to how I should wrap up my final half of my internship would be appreciated :(("

Right now I do youtube full time(It's my only source of income I dont work a regular job)   and spend a few hours a day working on videos and everything. My concern though is if I go to back to school and major in CS would I be able to juggle both? If im already having to spend a few hours a day with Youtube I imagine I would also have to spend a few hours a day with  CS as well since I've heard it can be quite a difficult major.

I have a deadline coming up very soon (very very soon) and I am extremely undecided.

csMajors,Rant About Attending a Good CS School,1666329769,"I go to a T5 CS school. Coursework is pretty demanding. Sometimes it feels like the work never stops coming in until the semester ends. I don't love software engineering and sometimes I wonder if it's because I never got to experience programming for leisure. This major at this school trades off with my ability to leetcode/prep for interviews, code projects, participate in hackathons, etc. I've certainly been stressed and depressed but I pull through and am above average. But is it really worth it? It's not like I'm going into academia which is half the reason one would want to attend a great CS school. Maybe it's just absence of grade inflation at my school that makes me worry about and work for my grades more.

If I went to a different school I wouldn't have a brand name on my resume but I feel that I'd be able to focus on all the aforementioned things since I'd have a ton of extra time. I'd definitely be a more desirable SWE applicant. I might enjoy what I do a bit more. Anyone else in the same boat? Or do I just have the wrong mindset lol"
csMajors,UberSTAR Summer 2023 internship application timeline,1666329541,"I didn't find too much content last year so I figured I might just share my experience with everyone.

Application date: I applied in the summer, maybe August. I applied very early on.

Aug 31: Received an email from recruiter asking to fill out a form to set up the first interview. They asked my preferences on teams, locations, etc.

Sep 21: 1st interview. Went okay, I did fine and the recruiter probably thought I did well. 30-45 minutes later I received an email from the recruiter that I passed the interview and they would move me to the next round.

Oct 6: 2nd interview. The interviewer asked a lot of questions, I got nervous and I thought I did badly. Gave up on hoping I would pass.

Oct 11: Recruiter's email saying they have 'good news'. I guessed I passed.

Oct 12: Offer call with recruiter!"

csMajors,Too early to try and transition out of my job and into a job in the field?,1666328997," 

This summer I'll be finishing my associates in CS. I also have an unrelated STEM degree--a BS in Biology.

**Relevant classes I'll have under my belt:**

&gt;Calc I/II  
Physics I/II  
Discrete Mathmatics  
Intro to Java I, II  
Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (Java III)  
Comparative Operating Systems (more IT-based)  
Programming for Mobile Devices (Android Programming)  
Introduction to Python  
Database Design &amp; Application Development

Due to my BS, I'll be qualified to transition into graduate school for CS, which I plan on working on remotely.

I'm working 25 hours a week in an unrelated field to keep myself financially afloat while I finish my schooling.

I enjoyed my IT class and it seems like an easier field to break into in the meantime. Would it be crazy to study for the CompTIA A+ Certification exam so that I can at least hold an IT job while I do my graduate work, or am I better off just looking for something CS-related?

Is it too soon to be thinking about this stuff?"

At Salesforce I would be working for the Revenue cloud team which I think I might enjoy more but man, the resume boost Microsoft would give me is probably way better than Salesforce. Both are pretty good about giving return offers so I'm not too worried about new grad offers, assuming the economy doesn't tank.

&amp;#x200B;

It feels so tough this semester with just 3 courses: algorithms, unix scripting and calculus 1. Calculus 1 took up the majority of my time while scripting I didn't understand a thing at the beginning, but now I do and it's a chill class. But for algorithms, the 2nd previous assignment was so difficult it took me days to finish it. Now, my midterm is tomorrow for algorithms and I gotta do some practice on leetcode and review Big O as it takes me hours to figure out recursion. Next week, I have a math quiz and I'm falling behind in Calculus once more. It feels like torture that so many things are being shoved down my throat.

I sometimes hate this subject as I get impatient from time to time, but what keeps me here is the high pay in the long run, the easiest path to get an employment-based green card, job prospects, learn potential ideas for running a tech startup and the love of technology in general. But learning to build that technology is so much more brain sore than learning to use it."

I tried my best, been leetcoding for two years. 

I followed the textbook advice:

1 - Explain and communicate your thought process
2 - Ask interview whether he agrees with solution. 
3 - Implement and explain code snippets as you go. 

1st - interview went great. The interviewer even told me I did great on the question. Solved it, she pasted a bunch of test cases, and it passed all of them. 

Achieved optimal solution, and Answered Time and Space Complexity correctly. 

2nd - interview also went great. Interviewer and I we’re making lighthearted jokes and laughing. Solved his question, passed all test cases, answered Time and space Complexities, he asked me a follow up, and I have give a verbal solution. 

3rd- While it didn’t go as great as the others, I didn’t connect with the interviewer that well. I still solved the question, passed all test cases, and answered time and space correctly. 

The only 2 things that weren’t as smooth were 


1 - I tried a different syntax that didn’t work in the version of Java coderpad had. When I ran the code, it didn’t work, but I promptly identified and fixed the issue. 

2 - I had to google a small syntax thing, which they tell you is okay to do as long as you ask the interviewer. 



The same shit happened with Bloomberg and I don’t know what to do. 

I know I’m not red flagging. I’ve kind of been obsessed with coding interviews and have been living on this subreddit for the past 2 years. I don’t know where it could’ve went wrong, unless they are expecting a picture perfect 110% performance which the last interview might have ruined.

csMajors,In a weird pickle. I’m kinda waiting to get fired,1666289094,"After college, I was unemployed because I made terrible decisions in college. So I decided to grind leetcode for like 6 months while living at home. I wasn’t really even apply anywhere since my mind was set on FAANG companies and they weren’t hiring at the time of year. My dad got sick of it and made me get a job at a local tech company. 

He had every right to be mad. I was kind of being a little shit. But I actually got an interview shortly before I applied for a new grad role at a FAANG. Right before my start date for my current job, I got an offer. My start date at my new job is first week of February, so about four months away.  

My current job kinda sucks. I literally don’t do anything. There were low expectations for me at first but now one of my managers is getting on my ass. Nothing works. I run into hiccups whenever I try to do anything. The tech practices are terrible here. It’s just maintenance work. And we use a software stack that doesn’t resemble anything that any big tech company would use. There were multiple days I didn’t do a single productive thing and just wiggled my mouse on teams to make it look like I was there. I feel bad because they want me to learn and they’re kind, but I just can’t get myself to care at all. It would be almost of no use to me. I’d rather grind leetcode and do my own projects on my own time.

I almost want to quit, but I haven’t on the off chance my offer gets rescinded. It’s also nice to save a little I guess, but I’m not making that much tbh."

csMajors,Final Round Experience at Microsoft,1666284868,"So I had my final round yesterday at MS and I just wanted to let anyone else who's doing it soon know what to expect.

I originally applied through a conference I attended, Out 4 Undergrad. I was invited to join a recruiting call, and then got a phone screen later on. I heard back about a final round a week later. 

So the day of the interview, they had everyone who was interviewing join a kick off call in the morning. They basically just showed us a video and told us good luck. The call was a mix of job and internship interviews.

I had two rounds scheduled for that day. I found out through the chat that some interns had four rounds scheduled instead of two-- I couldn't get a straight answer as to whether that was good or bad news for me. 

For both rounds, they asked me first about a project from my resume, and then went into a codility problem. The first was an array problem, and despite it being easy I totally blanked. I tried to talk through it pretty well but it was rough. I didn't get it working.

For the second round I did much better, it was a string pattern matching question and I solved it in a reasonable amount of time. The interviewer then asked me more questions from my resume and then we ended. Thankfully I think I did well on the behavioral questions from both. If anything that'll be my saving grace.

All in all, it was a pretty standard interview process. Only weird thing was the discrepancy between people with 2 and 4 interview rounds. I doubt I'm gonna get the position since I messed up the first question, but you never know!

If you have your final round with MS coming up soon, its really nothing to be afraid of. Hopefully you do better than I did :) &lt;3"

I recently sent my transfer application to Rutgers New Brunswick for this spring’s semester and decided to shift my focus toward a CS degree. I have very little experience with coding and haven’t taken an advanced math course in years but I’m determined to put in the work.

I have been taking Harvard’s CS50x and brushing up on algebra/precalculus through Khan Academy. Math has never been my strong suit but it’s nothing some studying can’t help fix. CS50x has been engaging and while I understand the lectures, the problem sets have been tough for me to complete without a guide on YouTube.

I'm thinking about switching majors from Information Technology to Computer Science. I feel like Information Technology is a degree neutral job for most jobs and fields.

But as I'm applying for internships and ""practicing"" applying for jobs I've noticed there's a higher demand for computer science majors.

I'm also getting internship emails back, but as soon as I get the HackerRank assessments, I freeze up because I'm not that fluent in coding. I love coding but I only know the basis of what I've learned, I just haven't had time for it lately which kind of contradicts my love for code.

I don't mind doing IT as a career, but all of my dream jobs are like the FAANG companies, and building software or applications to help people. But math is hugely what is deterring me away from computer science.

IT equally interests me too, and I've been able to equally get internship emails back, but again its the HackerRack assessments that freeze me up.

csMajors,Dilemma Over Major and Possible Transfer,1666252381," 

THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL, BUT VERY LIKELY SCENARIO FOR ME.

18M, undergraduate freshman. I’ll make the story as short as I can.

I started majoring in pre med biology, and I’ve hated it so far. I’ve had no time for hobbies (writing music, and writing stories), and have been sad.

So I’ve been exploring other options. My big two interests are computer science and geology (I have more interest in geology). My current university offers a computer science major, but no geology major, only a singular class.

My dilemma is this. If I take the geology class and love it, then I wouldn’t have the ability to pursue that unless I transferred to another university, but since the other available universities are so far away from my home, I’d have to dorm, which I’m simply not willing to do (for money reasons and because I’m not willing to leave my family yet).

csMajors,Communications major (A.A) wondering if I should switch/pursue STEM,1666251176,"I'm in my first semester at a community college for an Associate's degree in Communications Studies. I picked that major because I like how versatile it is, and I'm not good at much else besides writing/humanities in general. Really, my heart wants to work somewhere along the lines of TV/Film production, but I also know that's extremely competitive and more about networking. I figured Communications would guarantee a variety of job prospects while still being close to media production.

Thing is, I'm already concerned about what I should do when I transfer to get my Bachelor's. A B.A in Communications doesn't sound promising for all the debt I'll take on when I transfer - much less a M.A. Same thing for a B.A or M.A in Film Studies.

The only STEM careers I think I'd be interested enough in is Psychiatry or Neuroscience. I've always been fascinated with the brain and mind. Bio isn't my strongest subject, but I could get better. That entails most likely going to medical school as I hear a MA in Psych also doesn't guarantee much. I probably won't have the time to gain experience in film on the side for a long period, but I'd be financially comfortable.

I'm considering getting my A.A in Communications anyway to use it for a job, then pursuing Psychiatry or Neuroscience, or switching my major now to Psychology to become a doctor eventually. I just don't know which is best if I want to be financially stable AND be in the arts.

TDLR: I guess the ultimate question is if a B.A or M.A in Communications would be a regrettable degree for the debt and job field vs. the many years to become a Psychiatrist or Neuroscientist."

I'm honestly not even thinking about quants though I do technically go to a target school. 

Obviously, I'm still applying and doing OAs, but I already got rejected from many top companies like Stripe and Bloomberg. I applied but did not hear back from any of the FAANG companies. I ""interned"" at a local no name company in sophomore year, but I honestly barely did anything. I also did not grind Leetcode over the summer as much as I should have, which is entirely my fault. Currently, I have a swe intern offer from a big 4 accounting firm, but it's definitely nowhere as good as an actual tech company and their new grad salary is shit. 

It's just so daunting because it seems like almost everyone at my school already copped a FAANG or equivalent internship at least once. There are few people here right now who are actually interning at Google while taking classes??? I didn't even know that was possible. I'm truly grateful to at least have one offer for the summer, but I'm really not sure how much it will help me get a good new grad offer when almost everyone in my graduating class is going to be getting a return offer from a FAANG.

Currently I am in my last semester with 3 courses and 1 of them being a research writing course that I absolutely hate. One of them is a programming course but is unrelated to my field. My last course is a overall comprehensive exam over my whole degree. 

I’m just so unhappy with school right now. Every night I’m doing hw and not being able to enjoy much right now. Every time I’m at my computer I feel guilty for not doing school. I’m barely passing the research class and everything is just unnecessarily hard in that course. On a assignment the class average was 7/20. Most of the others are slightly better average but not by much. This degree was basically free through my employer. However, I’m not really sure that this degree will really help me as a software developer since no one has ever heard of that type of degree before. It’s also from a small college. I’m 25 with about 4 YOE. Is it worth suffering for a month and a half more to possibly still fail or just cut ties and be happy?"
csMajors,How to provide a consolidated marksheet if my btech started from 3rd semester ?,1666236095,"Hello folks,

I am trying to apply for MS in Computer science for fall 2023 and there is a small problem that I am facing while submitting my applications. All the colleges need a consolidated marksheet which contains subject wise scores of all the semesters of your degree and MS colleges accept students with a 4 year degree only. So I have done a diploma (polytechnic) in Information technology and later I got lateral entry in Btech, which means I directly got admission in 2nd year, so, my consolidated marksheet starts from 3rd semester. My question is, has anyone here applied for MS with the same condition as mine ? Or you guys know someone who had applied with a diploma and 3 year btech degree ? Or if you guys know the solution to this, please let me know."
csMajors,Best major for a career in software engineering?,1666236046,"I’ve seen so many options from AAS in programming, AAS in networking, BS in computer science, BS in IT: web &amp; database concentration etc!

I’m overwhelmed by the options &amp; I am not sure which would make me the most qualified and prepared for a career in software engineering. 

If you specifically went to school for this, what was your major? If you’re successful in a software engineering career and only have a certificate or learned via other methods such as boot camps or self teaching, what did you do?

Also, any advice or tips to stand out amongst the crowd on job applications is welcome.

csMajors,"Landing Interviews, or not",1666230708,"I’m going to be *that* person, and say how in the world are applications and resumes filtered/ decided who gets an interview??

I applied to so many places for internships since the beginning of August and I’ve only heard back from either the very bottom of my interests or the extreme top. Theres been no in between and I just don’t understand it. 

My interview prospects have looked like: Chewy project management position in a warehouse where I, for some unspecified reason, would need to be able to lift 50 pounds, or Jane Street. 
Legit no middle responses. 
And I have applied to every last mid ground opening/ company that I’ve been able to find, along with the occasional bottom &amp; top for fun. I even resorted to networking on Linked In and attending online info sessions. Haven’t found much success with those tactics. 
I literally don’t understand how places are choosing? 

I’m not sure if matters, but most of the positions I’ve been going after have been PM or TPM; Occasionally swe or other position if it seems interesting/ fitting. I’ve received multiple OAs for swe (and a decent amount of OAs in ratio to the amount swe applications sent, do you send them to anybody?) but I decided to ignore them due to wanting pm for this summer."
csMajors,Optiver Final Round Invitation Question,1666230419,"Hi I finished the third round of the optiver SWE intern interview (technical one with software engineer) around a day ago and me and the interviewer were casually talking at the end when he mentioned that I would ""definitely be moving on to the final round"" and again later mentioned that ""the recruiters should be getting back to you with information regarding the final round."" I don't know if I'm paranoid or not but its been a day since the interview and I haven't received anything yet, which kinda surprised me as I thought the decision would be immediate. Is this something an interviewer would say, and do they have the power to push a candidate forward? I feel like I'm being paranoid but idk."
csMajors,finally got an offer but worried,1666229769,"So I recently got an offer which I'm happy to accept but they told me they could only process a written offer in January because I can start in may.. is this normal?

also, it's one of those places that are known to not sponsor H1B for internationals so they explicitly say they won't hire anyone who needs to use OPT /CPT.

But somehow they decided to interview me and i passed the final interview so they want to give me an offer. They told me they will consider sponsoring H1B after 1 year. 

I even told the recruiter that I need to use my OPT and he said it's fine. So now I'm confused if this is allowed in some special cases, (for some teams?) or if the recruiter actually doesn't know and I might not get the written offer at the end. 

Am I just overthinking this? or should I send another email to ask this? (I told the recruiter before the interview, and even after I got my offer)"

csMajors,CS BA/MS in 4 years vs CS BS in 3 years,1666226874,"Sorry if this has been asked before, but I wasn't able to find any prior posts. Just to give some background information, I go to a T25 with a weak cs department, in my second year with around 80 credits (3.8 gpa) after this fall, originally with the plan to graduate early with a BS in CS after 3 years. 

However I've been struggling to find an internship for next summer and someone recommended me to do the 4+1 program (in 4 years so 3+1 essentially) so I can have an extra summer, and also since I'm international, also increase my chances of getting a H1B in the future.

Is there any reason why I would do the CS BS in 3 rather than getting a MS by doing an additional year? Would it be better if I did it in 3, and applied to other MSCS programs at more prestigiuos schools for better placements?"

The career isn't as fulfilling as I thought it would be in terms of knowledge satisfaction. Debits and credits turned out to be not my jam. My expertise is mainly with Excel and Microsoft applications, not heavy programming. Once I pass my CPA exams (if I get there), I'll be going back to college to take information system computer courses.

 I am hearing tons of talk of about how even the most qualified computer programming students have hundreds of rejections until they get an internship, so how screwed am I in terms of not finding a job? Will my chances increase if I pursue a bachelor's degree instead of an associates in information systems?

I had no coding or programming experience, but I’m willing to learn. Fall 2022 is my first college semester ever and I’m doing well but it’s hard keeping up with everything, plus I also have kids.

My programming class is teaching me a lot, and it’s so rewarding figuring things out, but it takes so long for me to get the code right and my other assignments just pile up. Sometimes I get stuck completely and have to go online for help and feel guilty for doing so instead of sitting there and figuring it out. I’m wondering if I just suck at this for taking long with code or is it normal since this is the first time I’m ever doing this.

The only flip side is that when I look at other students’ computers, they’re WAY behind on their programming assignments so it makes me feel a little better. Lol. As bad at that sounds.

Did anyone else start off slow first learning this and eventually just pick it up? Guess I just need some motivation but I do not plan on quitting it. I knew going in that this wasn’t going to be a walk in the park."

I was kinda surprised by the call so I may have had a monotonous reaction and when the recruiter asked if I had any questions about this process I just said “no”, well, bc I didn’t have any questions and I thought this was just an informative call, not a behavioral, so I didn’t need to act interested? Did they like, retroactively reject me bc of how I acted or have they just not sent out the travel details still?"

I just went with it because l'm not really in a position to turn down a job. I ended up getting an offer from the place for the SDE I role but after I accepted and got access to Workday, I noticed that some of my onboarding tasks were labeled SDE I and some were labeled SDE II. I thought this was strange but I just got access to my Outlook today and it says I am an SDE II.

Should I say anything? Having SDE Il on my resume would definitely look better and I wouldn't want to get demoted but at the same time I feel like I wouldn't be getting compensated correctly and their cut off for yearly raises is October 1st so in May I wouldn't be eligible."
csMajors,"Internship, big name backend or LinkedIn Mobile?",1666147209,"Hi guys. I just finished my 2023 summer internship seeking and got two offers from LinkedIn and AMZ.

I’m struggling between these two choices. I value WLB and love LinkedIn, but it’s a mobile engineering role. 

I actually had an iOS engineer internship before. It’s a great experience but I’m not sure about the future of mobile engineer in the US market, compared with backend / full stack.

I don’t know if a mobile engineering internship will help me find full time job next year or not (maybe even have some negative impact to applying backend roles).

Really need to hear more perspectives. Is there anyone on the same boat? Let’s discuss!

AMZ
Pros:
Better return rate 
Very likely backend / full stack

Cons:
Greater pressure / pip
Not that hard to pass full-time interview 

LinkedIn
Pros:
Better WLB
Great working environment (love California)
More difficult to get in than Amazon

Cons:
Mobile Engineering (love it, just not sure if it’s a good choice)
Unknown return rate (heard it was very bad in 2020, lower than 20%)"

It’s not a struggle but it definitely takes a bit more work and is less fun than programming. Discrete math on the other hand is making me question wether I chose the wrong major. 

It may just be the shit professor and the lack of self studying but I can tell this is no piece of cake and I definitely don’t have an innate affinity towards it. 

I’ve even considered dropping it and doing the course in isolation (taking no other courses during the summer term) but it’s too late for that.

csMajors,Trouble deciding between two offers,1666145641,"So I am a junior at a top 10 CS school, majoring in Computer Science. I got two internship offers through career fair! However, I am having a hard time deciding between the two.

Company 1 (Fortune 100) - $28 hr, housing stipend -&gt; UI/UX Design Developer/ Design System Developer (Unsure of title atm)

I have a decent background with graphic design and art in general, so I always thought that UI/UX design was a great way to combine my two interests, art and tech. I love using tools like Figma, Adobe Illustrator, and really enjoyed the frontend development I have done in the past. At this company everyone I talked to and interviewed with was extremely nice. Overall I think there products are really cool, and I am a good culture fit. One of the guys that interviewed me had one spot left on his team and liked me enough to have me skip a stage of the interview process which was incredibly cool and nice of him. 

Company 2 (Fortune 500) - \~$35 hr, housing payed -&gt; Software Engineer Intern

This company I also met at Career fair. I had an in person behavioral interview with with a leetcode easy technical. I also had a final interview which was System design. Overall the people I met throughout this process were not as nice as Company 1, but very normal. The product that this company creates does not seem as cool as Company 1. However, the internship is mentor-based which could be really educational.

After doing some research it seems like Software Engineers definitely make more than UI/Design developers/Frontend engineers. As a Junior in college who is not exactly sure what I want to do in the future, is it more of a risk to take the UI/UX Design role? 

My concern is that having Software Engineer Intern at Company 2 will look more impressive and help me land higher paying jobs in the future as a software engineer. While I think I would rather do the work that Company 1 would have me do, I am afraid I might get stuck in that more design oriented field, and because of that get paid less. Money is obviously important to me, so it is also really hard to pass up Company 2 as it pays more and housing is included.

I started researching my campus' degree checklist for Cybersecurity(my current original major is CS) to check what classes I must take should I choose to double major. Turns out that half(if not more) than the classes I take on CS are already required on Cybersecurity! But if I double majored, I would have to take 11 more classes related to cybersecurity. My General education classes do not change, and the Cybersecurity degree does not require as much math as Computer Science does.  So to get Double Major I would need: Take all CS Classes like normal, take 11 additional(About cybersecurity AND a little bit of accounting) classes, take Gen Ed classes like normal. Is the additional classes worth the double major?

csMajors,Final pick for summer 2023 Internship,1666137639,"I interned at company 1 last summer making $26/hour, and was transferring to their DT program. There were interns who made $30 &amp; $33/hour. So I was definitely screwed salary wise compared to my peers but it was first internship so I didn't complain. I am working part time for them during the sem remotely and have been guararnteed a spot at DT and that I am getting an offer once I finish my fall internship. This internship would be based out of Cinncinati 

I recieved an offer at Company 2 for their D&amp;T program just last week and have to accept in one week. It is $5000 a month (31.25/hour). I reallly liked the people during this whole process but I am wondering if it is worth the movingcompanies. It is based out of Minneapolis. 

I am based in Michigan, and wondering which one should I take. I don't know if the 1st company would start me at the $33 an hour salary or the $30. Tbh the only think I know is the location and that I will get the offer in January. 

Both would give me opportunities in cybersecurity, data science, and cloud computing routes which are what I am interested in. 

So what do people thinl?"

csMajors,Can't move past behaviorials ??,1666135431,"In the weirdest twist yet, I've been getting rejected after HireVues + behavioral interviews. I honestly expected the behavioral to be the easiest part so it's strangely insulting (as in personally bc I can't help but think I have a terrible horrendous personality, or something) to be specifically roadblocked by this. 

For example, a while back I did a video call with an engineer at Kohl's and I personally thought it went okay (no coding, just asking questions about myself + some projects). I didn't think Kohl's would be too high stakes or anything, but a week after, I received a rejection. Same with Prudential (HireVue), even though it was a recruiter who reached out to me to apply. And another time with a smaller. local company (interview 1:1). I moved on after a behavioral with another company, but felt like the experience was similar to all the other interviews I had done. 

I don't really know how to explain how this has made me feel shittier than just not passing any tests on an OA. Obviously there's something significant that I'm missing, I just don't know what. I'm pretty outgoing and fairly well-spoken (at least, I think I'm okay at explaining and thinking off the cuff). Like??? Literally what is going on ??"

I live in Nebraska, and the company is offering $40/hr + remote work. I could go with them again, or I could go work at a different company for $32/hr.

So I guess my question is how important are varied experiences for your internships? If I worked at the same company again I'm sure my full-time offer will be even better.

- Have vast Linux knowledge and experience
- Received some offers from Local Companies. (Cloud Engineer, SWE, Server Administration positions in local top companies through campus recruitment/talent hunt programs etc) 
- Volunteering Experience in Computer Club (Director, hosted some CPCs)

Want to join FAANG or any other top Tech companies in the world. Does not have any work or study permit in any country outside Bangladesh. So, please guide me on which track I should follow.

Some of my friends are suggesting me to do Masters in US/Canada and get an internship/new grad position from there. According to them it is nearly impossible to land on FAANG or any other top companies from outside Europe / America. Is that true? 

Is it easier to land into FAANG from the Masters -&gt; Internship -&gt; Entry Level / New Grad path? Can't I just continue my job here + solve 300+ LCs -&gt; apply to the companies in Senior positions and expect an offer after completing OAs + Phone Call Interviews?

Pretty much since the start of university, I had a lot of interest in DSA/CP, and most of my seniors told that's the most important part for internships, so I overlooked everything else and focused just on that. Now the intern season arrived, all I had was pretty basic front end projects (won couple of hackathons with one of them) and a decent CP profile.

I got a perfect score in almost all the companies that I gave the online assessment test for, but got shortlisted for interviews just once, for which I got rejected in the final round. A lot of companies went on hiring freeze amidst the intern hiring procedures, so got quite unlucky. My resume is formatted as per the university format, and my cgpa is pretty high.

I started applying off campus, and I barely received any response to it. So, I've a couple of things I want advise on. How do I get an off campus internship?
And what changes should I make in my profile for the placements season, ie, should I start focusing more towards projects from now onwards or what should I do?

ANYWAYS do professors have to pay for a chegg subscription to see posted questions like we do, or do they get a free pass? I searched this up everyone and no answer. My professor seems chill and he said he only ever failed 1 student because he caught him cheating off someone else then said don’t do it again then he did it again. He said he will let everyone in the class pass. This class is so hard and I can’t even understand his thick accent too so I feel like he knows he has to be easy."

I will graduate after this winter quarter. I'll be real, I have no internship experience nor am that familiar with leetcode, I can solve some of the easy's and have only attempted a few so far.  I am a double major econ/cs. My dream is to work as a developer for a big bank or crypto institution. How realistic is it to get hired at these companies as a new grad, I hope easier than FAANG. I would even be completely fine with working for a big retail company that is not FAANG like Target as my first job. Would it be realistic or optimal to start at these companies, then transfer to a FAANG or big bank after a yoe or so? I don't want to fall in the trap in doing leetcode and interview prep for months after graduation just for the higher starting salary, even though it does mean alot, I'd just like to get immediate experience instead. But I also don't want to be making a relatively bad salary for years before I can transfer jobs. I have 4-5 months before graduation so I plan to polish up leetcode (as my runtime scores sucks but my memory scores are always high) and practice more on learning MERN.  BTW, my next quarter, which is my last quarter, will have an easier workload so I could potentially start applying as we speak, even with sucky leetcode skills, maybe starting a job in my last quarter if that is realistic?

I'm in a sticky situation that is kind of my fault, but basically:

* Offer A (already accepted)
   * Big bank, technology analyst (training program -&gt; associate)
   * Work is interesting, good base and benefits, but finance was never my first choice.
   * Don't know about equity yet, but I can imagine it's decent
   * Really like the people there and I was pretty set on going back until Offer B hit.
* Offer B
   * Tech company, makes product management products which are used pretty widely
   * Base pay is 10-20k less than Offer A as an associate (I think), but good RSUs and attractive work from anywhere policy
   * Feels like I can jump from tech to tech rather than finance to tech (which was the original plan)

I'm overwhelmed sometimes by the pressure of being a CS major and especially right now as I'm a senior student trying to find a job during a recession. I did 350 LC problems in a month, mostly medium and hard starting from 0 (That's like easily over 10 hours of programming per day). I go to a top 15 University with decent GPA and applied to around 100 companies only to receive less than 10 OA's. Thanks to the practice I had on LC I Aced all of the OA's but only 2 of them moved on to an interview. I don't know how much my international status as a Canadian or my identity as an Asian male factors into this.

I'm just kind of sad at this point. I know I wouldn't be broke even if I don't find a job as my family is fairly rich, making a couple of millions per year. At the same time I feel like my life that culminated to this point is pointless. This include doing well in school from primary school to get into a good secondary school, then to a good University, and lastly potentially landing a high paying job. Don't get me wrong: I like Computer Science, but I certainly don't like the above average pressure and work load that's associated with it. I guess this is only exacerbated by the fact that my parents have high expectations for me as I'm always that ""good kid"" growing up. I mean really high expectations that most people are going to fail on: go to grad school at MIT/Stanford, get a job at a FANNG, then go create your own startup after gaining a few years of experience."

csMajors,Anyone else not getting OAs but no rejections either?,1666053973,"Kinda mad NGL. I had a very relevant swe internship this Summer at a top tech company and I’m still getting 20% of the activity I saw last year. Out of all the apps I’ve done, I’ve only gotten mixed signals. 

1. I have the rejections from places that weren’t interested in me last year either

2. Rejections from places that have announced hiring freezes

3. 1 freaking OA

4. Radio silence on &gt;80% of apps

This really sucks, I did 30+ OAs last year and based on my hits, I really don’t think it’s my resume - if anything it should be way better bc of it! What should I do? I’m diving all in for LC the next few months. Most of these apps are for the big N/or niche companies that I think are interesting. I have a hard location preference for CA, but I can do NY or TX and I’ve applied to places in all 3. Should I set my sights on medium companies, and where to find these less competitive positions?

csMajors,American Express v. Epic Systems?,1666053255,"I'm a college senior graduating in May 2023, and have received offers for American Express in Sunrise, FL, and Epic Systems in Madison, WI. Epic's salary is 30k higher than American Express, and I would like living in the Madison more than Sunrise, but the Glassdoor reviews have me worried.

For example, Amex has an overall rating of 4.3, while Epic has 3.2. 93% of Amex employees approve of their CEO, while it's only 37% for Epic. I've heard that the work-life balance and tech stack isn't great at Epic, but from their demo on interview day, it seems like they've migrated to a more modern tech stack recently.

It seems crazy to leave 30k on the table for Amex, but I'm really worried about the reviews. I also have a final round with Vanguard this week, and am hearing back from PNC. The recruiter for Vanguard told me upfront that the salary ranges from 80k to 90k, so I'm wondering if I should cancel the final round or not. What would you do in my situation, both in terms of offers and final interviews?"

csMajors,PayPal Summer 2023 University Intern SE hackerrank?,1666053052,"So I got an email today inviting me to a hackerrank test.

Maybe I forgot to add it to my spreadsheet but I couldn’t find a PayPal application I sent for this position… I applied to a PayPal thing at one point (might’ve been before the spreadsheet was created) but I thought that was a new grad position I got rejected for??

Overall I didn’t think anything about this being legit or not, however when searching for info on what to expect from the PayPal intern interview process, and I found a deleted post from this sub from 5 days ago, however on the google search I could see this: https://imgur.com/a/QIajB3m

There's a couple of places I'm waiting to hear back from that I think I have some chance at, but that chance is still slim. Most places are just ghosting me or screening me out at the beginning without an interview or OA. And the new postings are slowing down now. I sorted through my email confirmations and found I've applied to about 350 places in total more or less. Made sure to apply to about at least a dozen places per day. Still no luck. Only offer I got was for some no-name sports store out in Texas paying like $8 an hour for working with IT and Excel sheets. I would've taken it if it didn't mean having to relocate 500+ miles at my own expense. So I'm just going to have to apply for Fall 2023 positions when they open.

I found an summer position and worked full-time during the day at the internship and my othet boss let me move to part-time for the other position at night. My internship got extended to the Fall and I decided to take the risk of quitting my other job because I couldn't do two jobs and school as it would kill me physically and mentally. I've been absolutely depressed since I'm running through my savings so much more faster than I thought I would be and I was worried I made a mistake.
I kept applying everywhere and anywhere and finally got two offers for the Summer! But I was worried because I still needed to fill the Spring because that's 6 months with no income... It was hard looking for positions in the spring as they are very rare and are usually co-ops. But I never gave up and the universe is repaying me!
I just accepted an offer for the Spring with a big name tech company for the spring and will soon be deciding between two big name aerospace companies for the summer!

They had raised the whiteboard higher which made it harder for my friends to reach the areas they needed to write and the interviewer made somewhat subliminal comments about my friend's height.

And I went in with literally 0 warm-up. When time was up I was so in the zone that I could have killed it with another go. 

I had it “solved”, but a little error or two in my code, ykwim? I didn’t pass half the test cases and I never heard back from them.

Obviously I could have prepared myself, but I blame it on how I spent my time the last month. Instead of LC and applications, I tried out engineering and physics related clubs at school. The lesson is that DraftKings, FAANG, etc, don’t do rocket science. And I wasted my time working on rocket science related problems.

Here’s how: In classes, focus on core concepts and logic rather than the actual “code” being written. After that, get extremely comfortable in one language, and take several courses in that language (C++ or Python are strong choices for industry) From there, OAs and interview code come more naturally with time.

* Cons: Hate the rain, lack of friends/pre-existing network, homelessness 


DC 

* Pros: More friends in DC, gf of 4 months will be in DC post-grad, ""better"" weather, close to NYC (I wanna move there eventually post-grad), HQ2 being built (semi-exciting to see?), my team is chill, team has great wlb, org is AWS, has better urban design, DC has a nice metro system so no need for car

* Cons: Far from family, less culture fit (not into politics), fewer adjacent tech companies, terrible summer weather, terrible food scene, smaller office building (no bezos balls)

The company's internship positions are now open and there are three that I am very interested in.

csMajors,College mate who kept copying our assessment answers to pass got a job at a large corporation,1665945300,"TLDR: a college mate who has rode on me and other friends to pass her assignments got a job as a software engineer at bae. Makes me feel life is truly unfair


Context: I went back to college last year to do my masters. It’s a computer science conversion course designed for people with non-CS bachelor’s. 

There’s a girl in my friend group and I really dislike. Let’s call her A. 

IMO, A was really bad in coding. She struggled to understand basic concepts and would always get answers from us for courseworks. For an assignment, another friend was guiding her how to do it but she just got so frustrated and couldn’t even understand it that the friend ended up giving her the answers. She got a 100% and went around telling people it was an easy assignment. 

In another occasion, I offered to help her on a question she was stuck and it turned out she didn’t even understand how to read the table. I had to teach her that from scratch. There were also multiple occasions where the friend group would do quizzes together and she just copied our answers without contributing. 

Basically, whenever there’s an assessment or assignment, she only took answers and never shared hers. Once, when I told the friend group that I was struggling with one question in the assignment, she said “I’m so happy to hear that you don’t know how to do that. It makes me feel good about myself because you always seems to know stuff. It’s nice to know you don’t know everything.”. Honestly I felt fking insulted.

Two other friends in the friend group distanced themselves from her. Turns out I was not the only one that felt she was using us to get answers for assessments. They also said that she always exaggerates her successes to try to make herself look great. I felt the same too.

The last time I heard from her was 3 months ago before I started my college placement year as a software engineer. She said she failed some exams but because she did well in assignments, she passed the module overall and didn’t have to resit any exams. She also said she was interviewing at a big corporation. 

I was shocked about her interview. I felt that she doesn’t deserve it because her coding skills were really bad, she basically rode on others to pass college. It was also a corporation I applied to but failed. Unfortunately, I’ll never know if I failed because of the interview, or because I’m an international and the corporation states that they deal with sensitive information so some positions are only open to local nationals. 

Today, I found out that she got the job and have been working there for almost 3 months. I was furious and felt very unfair. Perhaps she did really well in the interviews but I’m angry that a person like her who couldn’t do college assignments managed to land a full time position as a software engineer in a corporation that many CS students dream of working at."

Huawei Cons: Honestly the only con I can think of is the intern community is definitely smaller at Huawei, and that idk if future employers will look at it negatively, 

AMD Pros: Zero risk of negatively impacting my further job searches, large intern community, can do a summer ‘24 internship after this since AMD is 12 months long

AMD Cons: Could be a lot of QA work

Cs student graduating next fall at non competitive state school, one prior SWE internship at a small company.

I want to get my masters in CS because 
1. I enjoy college and think it would be nice to continue learning cs
2. I want to continue to do internships and competitive programming until hopefully at some point with the right referrals, resume and prior internship names, I can land a FAANG or similar internship as a master’s student which I think would be a much easier potential entry point than new grad hire given the current climate.

csMajors,rant on the CS program at my university (feel free to comment about your own experiences),1665885094,"[this is a really long and emotional rant, just fed up with everything]

I feel so annoyed lol. UTSA is opening up this new data science school next semester, and there's two new bachelor degrees, data science and artificial intelligence....why are they so late to the game😭

I'm a CS major concentrating in data science rn and the program is so shitty. There's only like 4 actual classes I can add to my degree that have to do with data science I feel like I'm gonna graduate knowing nothing.
The CS degree isn't any better, it feels like most of the professors don't give two shits. And the ones that actually cared about us understanding the material retired or left UTSA. We're getting assignment homeworks and exams that been recycled for probably over a decade. And being taught through PowerPoint slides that have been recycled for even longer than that. We basically have to double down and put more effort into relearning what the professor tries to teach and lose time that would've been used to apply what we would've learned into our own personal projects. 
So working full time or having multiple jobs to be able to pay the stupid tuition like I have to do and I'm sure many other students too, is like academic suicide. 
We don't have enough time to reteach ourselves, and we definitely don't have enough time to create our own personal projects.
students I've met that actually excels in the classes and is able to work on their own portfolio for future internship and job applications aren't out there working a job. 
They're able to have the time and energy to turn the degree into something useful.
And some of them have been exposed to computers and programming since high school or even younger which makes them comfortable with the material despite the fact that the professors aren't teaching it well
There's so much I wish for in my life... I wish my family hadn't been so poor, I wish I had been told earlier that computers and engineering could have been an option for me to go into as a career, I wish I could just be a university student and just study as much as I want instead of trying to juggle so many jobs to fund for this degree, I wish I had the energy capacity to be able to come home from work study for my classes work on assignments and then work on personal projects and codes to add to my resume, I wish I had applied to even more scholarships in high school so that I could have the choice and opportunity to leave San Antonio and go to a school that could actually provide me what I needed.

Unfortunately wishes don't come true, so all I can do is keep my head down keep pushing forward and do my best and hope I can learn as much as I can before I graduate and hope that the company I work for in the future can fund me and invest in me to learn even more and redeem this degree.

Anyways good night."

I did the phone screen in Java, so should I expect to be allowed to answer coding Qs in Java, or should I make sure I also have good C++ knowledge?

Yet the algorithms he goes over aren't the main ones we should know. He's gone on and on about recurrence relations and hasn't explained at all how Big O/Omega/Theta work. The algorithms he does go over are things like greedy algorithms, which from my understanding only work less than 50% of the time (I could be wrong about it). I've already emailed the administrator about his lack of teaching and the insults to the class every single lecture, and the admin talked to him, but nothing has changed. If I fail this class, I'm not graduating this semester. I'm at a loss of what to do at this point. Should I email the admin again?"

Immediately; I had no idea what the question even was. It felt like it just threw a bunch of code in my face with no direction of WTF to actually do with it. during the 'practice test' I just looked around for the 'Question' till I gave up.  I could not really figure out What the question was, what the desired output was, etc. I was clueless....

I tried a few more questions, and it felt like 3-20 that I tried actually had a 'question' or some kind of direction of what it wanted me to accomplish. The other 17 I could not figure out what it even wanted of me.  Like give me the desired output, something, ANYTHING.

Hello all!

Graduating 2023, so 0 YOE

I received an offer from Lockheed Martin for \~$80,000 TC (base + bonus) about 2 weeks ago, deadline is in a couple days. The job will be in-person in Forth Worth, TX and will require security clearance. I currently live in Austin, TX, so the COL will be quite similar, maybe cheaper in FW. The only problem is that while it would not be impossible to move to Forth Worth, I don't think it's a city that I would like to live or build a career in (if you are from FW, please change my mind) vs Austin, TX.

I also interned at a FinTech company this past summer and I was verbally offered a full-time position, with expectation that they would be sending the formal offer out by 3 weeks after the end of summer. It has been 5 weeks, and I have been reaching out to my director (who verbally offered) and my recruiter, and they said they were still awaiting approval from higher ups. They've been saying that they would be able to send out offers the following week, repeatedly for 3 weeks now. It's the end of the 5th week and the director just said that ""discussions are still going at the level above him and that hopefully they'll know by next week"", which is the week that I must reply to the LM offer. From talk that I've been hearing &amp; levels.fyi, the offer will be around 90-95k base. I also enjoyed working with my team this past summer, so on top of the perceived higher TC, I would know what team I'd be working with.

I know next May is somewhat of a long way, but LM is my only offer so far. LM seems great, but the combined cons mentioned above means that I will be interviewing for other companies that will naturally be better between now and graduation. Should I just accept the LM offer and renege if I get the offer from my internship? Is reneging even okay?

**TLDR:**

**Lockheed:**

\--Pros--

* Missiles and Propulsion team. Military defense projects, so cooler I think??
* Only offer on the table right now, so safety in this recession  
\--Cons--
* !!! In Forth Worth, TX. Far from family/friends. Not an exciting city!!!
* TC is somewhat low.
* Will have to renege if I get offer from another company that promised verbal offer."

csMajors,Desperation Post (Kinda): Options for Employment,1665792617,"The reason I said this is kind of a desperation post is cuz I’m still pretty optimistic in regards to all the callbacks I’ve been getting but there’s just this anxiety lurking in the back of my mind. To give you context, I graduated this past May with my BS. I have no internships under my belt as I only took 3 years and wasn’t able to get anything through the last 2 summers. I took way too long to apply as I had personal and family issues to deal with throughout the summer, and now, I am kinda scrambling for jobs. I was hoping I could find some answers to my questions here. I’ll listen them out below:
1. Are there any places I can apply to get a job this late? Doesn’t have to be big.
2. What should I do to increase my chances for the next hiring period to get into a major tech company, as I will no longer meet the requirements of “new grad”?
3. In the worst case scenario where I cannot find employment anywhere, is there anything I can do?"

I was invited to participate in the JPMorgan Code For Good (CFG) Hackathon in Columbus in a few weeks. It seems that this serves as a sort of final interview for the summer internship. However, I have already gotten a rejection from the JPMorgan internship before my invitation (screwed up my HackerRank unfortunately). Is it pointless for me to go? Or could I still have a shot at the position for this year or next?"
